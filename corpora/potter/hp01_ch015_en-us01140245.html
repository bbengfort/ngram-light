have been worse.</p> <p>Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall&rsquo;s study on
the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to
each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild
cover-up stories chased each other around Harry&rsquo;s brain, each
more feeble than the last. He couldn&rsquo;t see how they were
going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How
could they have been so stupid as to forget the Cloak? There was no
reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their
being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of
night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was
out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility
Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.</p>    <p>Had Harry thought that things couldn&rsquo;t have been worse? He
was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading
Neville.</p>   <p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; Neville burst out, the moment he saw the
other two. &ldquo;I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard
Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag
&mdash;&rdquo;</p>    <p>Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than
Norbert as she towered over the three of them.</p>     <p>&ldquo;I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch
says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It&rsquo;s one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. <i>Explain yourselves.&rdquo;</i></p>    <p>It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a
teacher&rsquo;s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still
as a statue.</p>      <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got a good idea of what&rsquo;s been
going on,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some
cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed
and into trouble. I&rsquo;ve already caught him. I suppose you
think it&rsquo;s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and
believed it, too?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry caught Neville&rsquo;s eye and tried to tell him without
words that this wasn&rsquo;t true, because Neville was looking
stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville &mdash; Harry knew what
it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn
them.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgusted,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall.
&ldquo;Four students out of bed in one night! I&rsquo;ve never
heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had
more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more
to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions &mdash;
yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, <i>nothing</i> gives you the right to
walk around school at night, especially these days, it&rsquo;s very
dangerous &mdash; and fifty points will be taken from
Gryffindor.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fifty?&rdquo;</i> Harry gasped &mdash; they would lose
the lead, the lead he&rsquo;d won in the last Quidditch match.</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty points <i>each,</i>&rdquo; said Professor
McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Professor &mdash; please &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what I can and can&rsquo;t do,
Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I&rsquo;ve never been more
ashamed of Gryffindor students.&rdquo;</p><p>A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last
place. In one night, they&rsquo;d ruined any chance Gryffindor had
had for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped
out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t sleep all night. He could hear Neville
sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry
couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew
Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen
when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they&rsquo;d done?</p><p>At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that
recorded the House points the next day thought there&rsquo;d been a
mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points
fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry
Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch
matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other
stupid first years.</p><p id="HP01CH15M01S">From being one of the most popular and
admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had
been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry
went, people pointed and didn&rsquo;t trouble to lower their voices
as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he
walked past them, whistling and cheering, &ldquo;Thanks Potter, we
owe you one!&rdquo;</p><p>Only Ron stood by him.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and
George have lost loads of points in all the time they&rsquo;ve been
here, and people still like them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in
one go, though, have they?&rdquo; said Harry miserably.</p><p>&ldquo;Well &mdash; no,&rdquo; Ron admitted.</p><p id="HP01CH15M01E">It was a bit late to repair the
damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that
weren&rsquo;t his business from now on. He&rsquo;d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he
went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Resign?&rdquo;</i> Wood thundered. &ldquo;What
good&rsquo;ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if
we can&rsquo;t win at Quidditch?&rdquo;</p><p>But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team
wouldn&rsquo;t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to
speak about him, they called him &ldquo;the Seeker.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn&rsquo;t have
as bad a time as Harry, because they weren&rsquo;t as well-known,
but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped
drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and
working in silence.</p><p>Harry was almost glad that the exams weren&rsquo;t far away. All
the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron,
and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night,
trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn
charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical
discoveries and goblin rebellions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Then, about a week before the exams were due to start,
Harry&rsquo;s new resolution not to interfere in anything that
didn&rsquo;t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking
back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody
whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard
Quirrell&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;No &mdash; no &mdash; not again, please
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved
closer.</p><p>&ldquo;All right &mdash; all right &mdash;&rdquo; he heard
Quirrell sob.</p><p>Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom
straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was
about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn&rsquo;t think
Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell&rsquo;s
footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was
empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway
toward it before he remembered what he&rsquo;d promised himself
about not meddling.</p><p>All the same, he&rsquo;d have gambled twelve Sorcerer&rsquo;s
Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had
just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step
&mdash; Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.</p><p>Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron
on Astronomy. Harry told them what he&rsquo;d heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Snape&rsquo;s done it, then!&rdquo; said Ron. &ldquo;If
Quirrell&rsquo;s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still Fluffy, though,&rdquo; said
Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Snape&rsquo;s found out how to get past him without
asking Hagrid,&rdquo; said Ron, looking up at the thousands of
books surrounding them. &ldquo;I bet there&rsquo;s a book somewhere
in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So
what do we do, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron&rsquo;s eyes,
but Hermione answered before Harry could.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to Dumbledore. That&rsquo;s what we should have done
ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we&rsquo;ll be thrown out
for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got no <i>proof</i>!&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;Quirrell&rsquo;s too scared to back us up. Snape&rsquo;s
only got to say he doesn&rsquo;t know how the troll got in at
Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor &mdash; who
do you think they&rsquo;ll believe, him or us? It&rsquo;s not
exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore&rsquo;ll think we made it
up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn&rsquo;t help us if his life
depended on it, he&rsquo;s too friendly with Snape, and the more
students get thrown out, the better, he&rsquo;ll think. And
don&rsquo;t forget, we&rsquo;re not supposed to know about the
Stone or Fluffy. That&rsquo;ll take a lot of explaining.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;If we just do a bit of poking around &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry flatly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve done
enough poking around.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the
names of its moons.</p><p class="break">The following morning, notes were delivered to
Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all
the same:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent">Your detention will take place at eleven o&rsquo;clock
tonight.</p><p class="noindent">Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.</p><p class="noindent"><img src="images/professor_sig.jpg" width="250" height="61" alt="Professor M McGonagall Signature"/></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Harry had forgotten they still had detentions
to do in the furor over the points they&rsquo;d lost. He half
expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of
studying lost, but she didn&rsquo;t say a word. Like Harry, she
felt they deserved what they&rsquo;d got.</p><p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in
the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.
Filch was already there &mdash; and so was Malfoy. Harry had also
forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading
them outside.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;ll think twice about breaking a school
rule again, won&rsquo;t you, eh?&rdquo; he said, leering at them.
&ldquo;Oh yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hard work and pain are the best
teachers if you ask me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s just a pity
they let the old punishments die out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hang you
by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I&rsquo;ve got the
chains still in my office, keep &rsquo;em well oiled in case
they&rsquo;re ever needed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right, off we go,
and don&rsquo;t think of running off, now, it&rsquo;ll be worse for
you if you do.&rdquo;</p><p>They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing.
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be
something really horrible, or Filch wouldn&rsquo;t be sounding so
delighted.</p><p>The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing
them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of
Hagrid&rsquo;s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get
started.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart rose; if they were going to be working with
Hagrid it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. His relief must have showed in
his face, because Filch said, &ldquo;I suppose you think
you&rsquo;ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,
boy &mdash; it&rsquo;s into the forest you&rsquo;re going and
I&rsquo;m much mistaken if you&rsquo;ll all come out in one
piece.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead
in his tracks.</p><p>&ldquo;The forest?&rdquo; he repeated, and he didn&rsquo;t sound
quite as cool as usual. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go in there at night
&mdash; there&rsquo;s all sorts of things in there &mdash;
werewolves, I heard.&rdquo;</p><p>Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry&rsquo;s robe and made a
choking noise.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your problem, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
Filch, his voice cracking with glee. &ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve thought
of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his
heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows
hung over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Abou&rsquo; time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bin
waitin&rsquo; fer half an hour already. All right, Harry,
Hermione?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,&rdquo;
said Filch coldly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re here to be punished, after
all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why yer late, is it?&rdquo; said Hagrid,
frowning at Filch. &ldquo;Bin lecturin&rsquo; them, eh? &rsquo;Snot
your place ter do that. Yeh&rsquo;ve done yer bit, I&rsquo;ll take
over from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back at dawn,&rdquo; said Filch, &ldquo;for
what&rsquo;s left of them,&rdquo; he added nastily, and he turned
and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the
darkness.</p><p>Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going in that forest,&rdquo; he said, and
Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,&rdquo; said
Hagrid fiercely. &ldquo;Yeh&rsquo;ve done wrong an&rsquo; now
yeh&rsquo;ve got ter pay fer it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But this is servant stuff, it&rsquo;s not for students to
do. I thought we&rsquo;d be copying lines or something, if my
father knew I was doing this, he&rsquo;d &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; tell yer that&rsquo;s how it is at
Hogwarts,&rdquo; Hagrid growled. &ldquo;Copyin&rsquo; lines! What
good&rsquo;s that ter anyone? Yeh&rsquo;ll do summat useful or
yeh&rsquo;ll get out. If yeh think yer father&rsquo;d rather you
were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an&rsquo; pack. Go
on!&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy didn&rsquo;t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but
then dropped his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Right then,&rdquo; said Hagrid, &ldquo;now, listen
carefully, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s dangerous what we&rsquo;re gonna
do tonight, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo; want no one takin&rsquo; risks.
Follow me over here a moment.&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH15M02S">He led them to the very edge of the
forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding
earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light
breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.</p><p>&ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; said Hagrid, &ldquo;see that stuff
shinin&rsquo; on the ground? Silvery stuff? That&rsquo;s unicorn
blood. There&rsquo;s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday.
We&rsquo;re gonna try an&rsquo; find the poor thing. We might have
ter put it out of its misery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us
first?&rdquo; said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his
voice.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; that lives in the forest
that&rsquo;ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,&rdquo; said Hagrid.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; keep ter the path. Right, now, we&rsquo;re gonna
split inter two parties an&rsquo; follow the trail in
diff&rsquo;rent directions. There&rsquo;s blood all over the place,
it must&rsquo;ve bin staggerin&rsquo; around since last night at
least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want Fang,&rdquo; said Malfoy quickly, looking at
Fang&rsquo;s long teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;All right, but I warn yeh, he&rsquo;s a coward,&rdquo;
said Hagrid. &ldquo;So me, Harry, an&rsquo; Hermione&rsquo;ll go
one way an&rsquo; Draco, Neville, an&rsquo; Fang&rsquo;ll go the
other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we&rsquo;ll send up
green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an&rsquo; practice now
&mdash; that&rsquo;s it &mdash; an&rsquo; if anyone gets in
trouble, send up red sparks, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll all come
an&rsquo; find yeh &mdash; so, be careful &mdash; let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p><p>The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they
reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid
took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the
right.</p><p>They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and
then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of
silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.</p><p>Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Could</i> a werewolf be killing the unicorns?&rdquo;
Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Not fast enough,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not easy ter catch a unicorn, they&rsquo;re powerful magic
creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running
water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still
spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.</p><p>&ldquo;You all right, Hermione?&rdquo; Hagrid whispered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo; worry, it can&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve gone far if
it&rsquo;s this badly hurt, an&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll be able ter
&mdash; GET BEHIND THAT TREE!&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path
behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into
his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them
listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it
sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was
squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound
faded away.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
summat in here that shouldn&rsquo; be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A werewolf?&rdquo; Harry suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo; no werewolf an&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo; no
unicorn, neither,&rdquo; said Hagrid grimly. &ldquo;Right, follow
me, but careful, now.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Hagrid called. &ldquo;Show
yerself &mdash; I&rsquo;m armed!&rdquo;</p><p>And into the clearing came &mdash; was it a man, or a horse? To
the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a
horse&rsquo;s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail.
Harry and Hermione&rsquo;s jaws dropped.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Ronan,&rdquo; said Hagrid in relief.
&ldquo;How are yeh?&rdquo;</p><p>He walked forward and shook the centaur&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening to you, Hagrid,&rdquo; said Ronan. He had a
deep, sorrowful voice. &ldquo;Were you going to shoot
me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too careful, Ronan,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
patting his crossbow. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s summat bad loose in this
forest. This is Harry Potter an&rsquo; Hermione Granger, by the
way. Students up at the school. An&rsquo; this is Ronan, you two.
He&rsquo;s a centaur.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d noticed,&rdquo; said Hermione faintly.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Ronan. &ldquo;Students, are
you? And do you learn much, up at the school?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Erm &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; said Hermione timidly.</p><p>&ldquo;A bit. Well, that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo; Ronan sighed.
He flung back his head and stared at the sky. &ldquo;Mars is bright
tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Hagrid, glancing up, too.
&ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve run inter yeh, Ronan,
&rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s a unicorn bin hurt &mdash; you seen
anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly
upward, then sighed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Always the innocent are the first victims,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;So it has been for ages past, so it is now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Hagrid, &ldquo;but have yeh seen
anythin&rsquo;, Ronan? Anythin&rsquo; unusual?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mars is bright tonight,&rdquo; Ronan repeated, while
Hagrid watched him impatiently. &ldquo;Unusually bright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I was meanin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; unusual a
bit nearer home,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;So yeh haven&rsquo;t
noticed anythin&rsquo; strange?&rdquo;</p><p>Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said,
&ldquo;The forest hides many secrets.&rdquo;</p><p>A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow
again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied
and wilder-looking than Ronan.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo, Bane,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;All
right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well enough. Look, I&rsquo;ve jus&rsquo; bin askin&rsquo;
Ronan, you seen anythin&rsquo; odd in here lately? There&rsquo;s a
unicorn bin injured &mdash; would yeh know anythin&rsquo; about
it?&rdquo;</p><p>Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.</p><p>&ldquo;Mars is bright tonight,&rdquo; he said simply.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; said Hagrid grumpily.
&ldquo;Well, if either of you do see anythin&rsquo;, let me know,
won&rsquo;t yeh? We&rsquo;ll be off, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring
over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked
their view.</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Hagrid irritably, &ldquo;try an&rsquo;
get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not
interested in anythin&rsquo; closer&rsquo;n the moon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are there many of <i>them</i> in here?&rdquo; asked
Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, a fair few.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Keep themselves to
themselves mostly, but they&rsquo;re good enough about
turnin&rsquo; up if ever I want a word. They&rsquo;re deep, mind,
centaurs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they know things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
jus&rsquo; don&rsquo; let on much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think that was a centaur we heard
earlier?&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me,
that was what&rsquo;s bin killin&rsquo; the unicorns &mdash; never
heard anythin&rsquo; like it before.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking
nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were
being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow
with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione
grabbed Hagrid&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in
trouble!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two wait here!&rdquo; Hagrid shouted. &ldquo;Stay on
the path, I&rsquo;ll come back for yeh!&rdquo;</p><p>They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood
looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn&rsquo;t hear
anything but the rustling of leaves around them.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve been hurt, do
you?&rdquo; whispered Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if Malfoy has, but if
something&rsquo;s got Neville&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s our
fault he&rsquo;s here in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual.
Harry&rsquo;s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every
cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?</p><p>At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid&rsquo;s
return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming.
Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as
a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky ter catch anythin&rsquo; now, with
the racket you two were makin&rsquo;. Right, we&rsquo;re
changin&rsquo; groups &mdash; Neville, you stay with me an&rsquo;
Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an&rsquo; this idiot. I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;ll have a harder time frightenin&rsquo; you, an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ve gotta get this done.&rdquo;</p><p>So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and
Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into
the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow
because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to
be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as
though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close
by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches
of an ancient oak.</p><p>&ldquo;Look &mdash;&rdquo; he murmured, holding out his arm to
stop Malfoy.</p><p>Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched
closer.</p><p>It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never
seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were
stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread
pearly-white on the dark leaves.</p><p>Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made
him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing
quivered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then, out of the shadows, a hooded
figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.
Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure
reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the
animal&rsquo;s side, and began to drink its blood.</p><p id="HP01CH15M02E">&ldquo;AAAAAAAAAAARGH!&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted &mdash; so did Fang.
The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry &mdash;
unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and
came swiftly toward Harry &mdash; he couldn&rsquo;t move for
fear.</p><p>Then a pain like he&rsquo;d never felt before pierced his head;
it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered
backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something
jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.</p><p>The pain in Harry&rsquo;s head was so bad he fell to his knees.
It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had
gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one
looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; said the centaur, pulling Harry
to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; thank you &mdash; what <i>was</i>
that?&rdquo;</p><p>The centaur didn&rsquo;t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes,
like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes
lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry&rsquo;s
forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;You are the Potter boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had
better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time
&mdash; especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this
way.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Firenze,&rdquo; he added, as he lowered
himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his
back.</p><p>There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side
of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees,
their flanks heaving and sweaty.</p><p>&ldquo;Firenze!&rdquo; Bane thundered. &ldquo;What are you
doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a
common mule?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you realize who this is?&rdquo; said Firenze.
&ldquo;This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest,
the better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What have you been telling him?&rdquo; growled Bane.
&ldquo;Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against
the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of
the planets?&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan pawed the ground nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Firenze
thought he was acting for the best,&rdquo; he said in his gloomy
voice.</p><p>Bane kicked his back legs in anger.</p><p>&ldquo;For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are
concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to
run around like donkeys after stray humans in our
forest!&rdquo;</p><p>Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that
Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not see that unicorn?&rdquo; Firenze bellowed at
Bane. &ldquo;Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the
planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is
lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I
must.&rdquo;</p><p>And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he
could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane
behind them.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t have a clue what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s Bane so angry?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What
was that thing you saved me from, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in
case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry&rsquo;s
question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so
long that Harry thought Firenze didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him
anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of
trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used
for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry, startled by the odd question.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only used the horn and tail hair in
Potions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a
unicorn,&rdquo; said Firenze. &ldquo;Only one who has nothing to
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood
of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from
death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and
defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your
lips.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stared at the back of Firenze&rsquo;s head, which was
dappled silver in the moonlight.</p><p>&ldquo;But who&rsquo;d be that desperate?&rdquo; he wondered
aloud. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be cursed forever,
death&rsquo;s better, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Firenze agreed, &ldquo;unless all you need
is to stay alive long enough to drink something else &mdash;
something that will bring you back to full strength and power
&mdash; something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do
you know what is hidden in the school at this very
moment?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone! Of course &mdash; the Elixir
of Life! But I don&rsquo;t understand who &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to
return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their
chance?&rdquo;</p><p>It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around
Harry&rsquo;s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to
hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met:
&ldquo;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had
enough human left in him to die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; Harry croaked, &ldquo;that was
<i>Vol</i> &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Harry, are you all right?&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing
along behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; said Harry, hardly knowing what he
was saying. &ldquo;The unicorn&rsquo;s dead, Hagrid, it&rsquo;s in
that clearing back there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is where I leave you,&rdquo; Firenze murmured as
Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. &ldquo;You are safe
now.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry slid off his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck, Harry Potter,&rdquo; said Firenze. &ldquo;The
planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope
this is one of those times.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest,
leaving Harry shivering behind him.</p><p class="break">Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room,
waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch
fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds,
though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione
what had happened in the forest.</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t sit down. He paced up and down in front of
the fire. He was still shaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and Voldemort&rsquo;s waiting in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get
rich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop saying the name!&rdquo; said Ron in a terrified
whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.</p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t listening.</p><p>&ldquo;Firenze saved me, but he shouldn&rsquo;t have done
so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane was furious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he
was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
happen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They must show that Voldemort&rsquo;s
coming back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane thinks Firenze should have
let Voldemort kill me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose that&rsquo;s
written in the stars as well.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Will you stop saying the name!&rdquo;</i> Ron
hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;So all I&rsquo;ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal
the Stone,&rdquo; Harry went on feverishly, &ldquo;then Voldemort
will be able to come and finish me off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well,
I suppose Bane&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of
comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, everyone says Dumbledore&rsquo;s the only one
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around,
You-Know-Who won&rsquo;t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs
are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor
McGonagall says that&rsquo;s a very imprecise branch of
magic.&rdquo;</p><p>The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went
to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night&rsquo;s
surprises weren&rsquo;t over.</p><p>When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility
Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to
it:</p><div class="top"><p class="center"><b><i>Just in case.</i></b></p></div></body></html>
