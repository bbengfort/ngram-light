One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered
in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins
were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they
followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The
few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to
deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they
could fly off again.</p> <p>No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the
drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the
windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor
Snape&rsquo;s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose
in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their
hot cauldrons.</p>    <p>&ldquo;I do feel so sorry,&rdquo; said Draco Malfoy, one Potions
class, &ldquo;for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for
Christmas because they&rsquo;re not wanted at home.&rdquo;</p>   <p>He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle
chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish,
ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since
the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had
tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog
would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he&rsquo;d realized
that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at
the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So
Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about
having no proper family.</p>    <p>It was true that Harry wasn&rsquo;t going back to Privet Drive
for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week
before, making a list of students who would be staying for the
holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn&rsquo;t feel
sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas
he&rsquo;d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too,
because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit
Charlie.</p>     <p>When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a
large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet
sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that
Hagrid was behind it.</p>    <p>&ldquo;Hi, Hagrid, want any help?&rdquo; Ron asked, sticking his
head through the branches.</p>      <p>&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m all right, thanks, Ron.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you mind moving out of the way?&rdquo; came
Malfoy&rsquo;s cold drawl from behind them. &ldquo;Are you trying
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself
when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose &mdash; that hut of
Hagrid&rsquo;s must seem like a palace compared to what your
family&rsquo;s used to.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;WEASLEY!&rdquo;</p><p>Ron let go of the front of Malfoy&rsquo;s robes.</p><p>&ldquo;He was provoked, Professor Snape,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
&ldquo;Malfoy was insultin&rsquo; his family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,
Hagrid,&rdquo; said Snape silkily. &ldquo;Five points from
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn&rsquo;t more. Move
along, all of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree,
scattering needles everywhere and smirking.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; said Ron, grinding his teeth
at Malfoy&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;one of these days, I&rsquo;ll get
him &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate them both,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;Malfoy and
Snape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, cheer up, it&rsquo;s nearly Christmas,&rdquo;
said Hagrid. &ldquo;Tell yeh what, come with me an&rsquo; see the
Great Hall, looks a treat.&rdquo;</p><p>So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the
Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were
busy with the Christmas decorations.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Hagrid, the last tree &mdash; put it in the far
corner, would you?&rdquo;</p><p>The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe
hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering
Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny
icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.</p><p>&ldquo;How many days you got left until yer holidays?&rdquo;
Hagrid asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Just one,&rdquo; said Hermione. &ldquo;And that reminds
me &mdash; Harry, Ron, we&rsquo;ve got half an hour before lunch,
we should be in the library.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Ron, tearing his
eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles
blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches
of the new tree.</p><p>&ldquo;The library?&rdquo; said Hagrid, following them out of
the hall. &ldquo;Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren&rsquo;t
yeh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not working,&rdquo; Harry told him
brightly. &ldquo;Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel
we&rsquo;ve been trying to find out who he is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>what</i>?&rdquo; Hagrid looked shocked.
&ldquo;Listen here &mdash; I&rsquo;ve told yeh &mdash; drop it.
It&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to you what that dog&rsquo;s
guardin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; said Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;d like to tell us and save us the
trouble?&rdquo; Harry added. &ldquo;We must&rsquo;ve been through
hundreds of books already and we can&rsquo;t find him anywhere
&mdash; just give us a hint &mdash; I know I&rsquo;ve read his name
somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Hagrid
flatly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just have to find out for ourselves, then,&rdquo; said
Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to
the library.</p><p id="HP01CH12M01S">They had indeed been searching books
for Flamel&rsquo;s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because
how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to
steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,
not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.
He wasn&rsquo;t in <i>Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century,</i>
or <i>Notable Magical Names of Our Time;</i> he was missing, too,
from <i>Important Modern Magical Discoveries,</i> and <i>A Study of
Recent Developments in Wizardry.</i> And then, of course, there was
the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books;
thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.</p><p>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided
to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started
pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the
Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel
wasn&rsquo;t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a
specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of
the restricted books, and he knew he&rsquo;d never get one. These
were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at
Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense
Against the Dark Arts.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you looking for, boy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at
him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get out, then. Go on &mdash;
out!&rdquo;</p><p>Wishing he&rsquo;d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story,
Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed
they&rsquo;d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find
Flamel. They were sure she&rsquo;d be able to tell them, but they
couldn&rsquo;t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.</p><p>Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had
found anything, but he wasn&rsquo;t very hopeful. They had been
looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments
between lessons it wasn&rsquo;t surprising they&rsquo;d found
nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without
Madam Pince breathing down their necks.</p><p id="HP01CH12M01E">Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione
joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.</p><p>&ldquo;You will keep looking while I&rsquo;m away, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; said Hermione. &ldquo;And send me an owl if you find
anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel
is,&rdquo; said Ron. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be safe to ask
them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very safe, as they&rsquo;re both dentists,&rdquo; said
Hermione.</p><p class="break">Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were
having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the
dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than
usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting
fork &mdash; bread, English muffins, marshmallows &mdash; and
plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk
about even if they wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly
like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it
a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron&rsquo;s set was very old
and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged
to someone else in his family &mdash; in this case, his
grandfather. However, old chessmen weren&rsquo;t a drawback at all.
Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what
he wanted.</p><p>Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and
they didn&rsquo;t trust him at all. He wasn&rsquo;t a very good
player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him,
which was confusing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me there, can&rsquo;t
you see his knight? Send <i>him,</i> we can afford to lose
<i>him.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at
all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he
saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas,&rdquo; said Ron sleepily as Harry
scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.</p><p>&ldquo;You, too,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Will you look at
this? I&rsquo;ve got some presents!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you expect, turnips?&rdquo; said Ron, turning to
his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry&rsquo;s.</p><p>Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown
paper and scrawled across it was <i>To Harry, from Hagrid.</i>
Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously
whittled it himself. Harry blew it &mdash; it sounded a bit like an
owl.</p><p>A second, very small parcel contained a note.</p><p><i>We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.</i> Taped to the note was a
fifty-pence piece.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s friendly,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Weird!</i>&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What a shape! This
is <i>money</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can keep it,&rdquo; said Harry, laughing at how
pleased Ron was. &ldquo;Hagrid and my aunt and uncle &mdash; so who
sent these?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I know who that one&rsquo;s from,&rdquo; said
Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
&ldquo;My mum. I told her you didn&rsquo;t expect any presents and
&mdash; oh, no,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s made you a
Weasley sweater.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted
sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.</p><p>&ldquo;Every year she makes us a sweater,&rdquo; said Ron,
unwrapping his own, &ldquo;and mine&rsquo;s <i>always</i>
maroon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really nice of her,&rdquo; said Harry,
trying the fudge, which was very tasty.</p><p>His next present also contained candy &mdash; a large box of
Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.</p><p>This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It
was very light. He unwrapped it.</p><p>Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor
where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of those,&rdquo; he said in a hushed
voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he&rsquo;d gotten
from Hermione. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what I think it is &mdash;
they&rsquo;re really rare, and <i>really</i> valuable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was
strange to the touch, like water woven into material.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Invisibility Cloak,&rdquo; said Ron, a look
of awe on his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is &mdash; try it
on.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a
yell.</p><p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i>! Look down!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to
the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just
his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He
pulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanished
completely.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a note!&rdquo; said Ron suddenly. &ldquo;A
note fell out of it!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written in
narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following
words:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>Your father left this in my possession
before he died. It is time it was returned to you.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Use it well.</i></p><p><i>A Very Merry Christmas to you</i></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">There was no signature. Harry stared at the
note. Ron was admiring the Cloak.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give <i>anything</i> for one of these,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;<i>Anything.</i> What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had
sent the Cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?</p><p>Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door
was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry
stuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn&rsquo;t feel like
sharing it with anyone else yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, look &mdash; Harry&rsquo;s got a Weasley sweater,
too!&rdquo;</p><p>Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large
yellow F on it, the other a G.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s is better than ours, though,&rdquo; said
Fred, holding up Harry&rsquo;s sweater. &ldquo;She obviously makes
more of an effort if you&rsquo;re not family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you wearing yours, Ron?&rdquo; George
demanded. &ldquo;Come on, get it on, they&rsquo;re lovely and
warm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate maroon,&rdquo; Ron moaned halfheartedly as he
pulled it over his head.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got a letter on yours,&rdquo; George
observed. &ldquo;I suppose she thinks you don&rsquo;t forget your
name. But we&rsquo;re not stupid &mdash; we know we&rsquo;re called
Gred and Forge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this noise?&rdquo;</p><p>Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking
disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his
presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
Fred seized.</p><p>&ldquo;P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we&rsquo;re all
wearing ours, even Harry got one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I &mdash; don&rsquo;t &mdash; want &mdash;&rdquo; said
Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head,
knocking his glasses askew.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not sitting with the prefects today,
either,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Christmas is a time for
family.&rdquo;</p><p>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his
side by his sweater.</p><p id="HP01CH12M02S" class="break">Harry had never in all
his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys;
mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;
tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and
cranberry sauce &mdash; and stacks of wizard crackers every few
feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing
like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their
little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry
pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn&rsquo;t just bang, it
went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a
cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear
admiral&rsquo;s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High
Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard&rsquo;s hat for a
flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor
Flitwick had just read him.</p><p id="HP01CH12M02E">Flaming Christmas puddings followed
the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle
embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and
redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing
Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry&rsquo;s amazement,
giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.</p><p>When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a
stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of
non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and
his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and
Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs.
Norris&rsquo;s Christmas dinner.</p><p>Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious
snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for
breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room,
where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to
Ron. He suspected he wouldn&rsquo;t have lost so badly if Percy
hadn&rsquo;t tried to help him so much.</p><p>After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and
Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before
bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over
Gryffindor Tower because they&rsquo;d stolen his prefect badge.</p><p>It had been Harry&rsquo;s best Christmas day ever. Yet something
had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he
climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility
Cloak and whoever had sent it.</p><p>Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to
bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he&rsquo;d drawn the
curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own
bed and pulled the Cloak out from under it.</p><p>His father&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this had been his
father&rsquo;s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother
than silk, light as air. <i>Use it well,</i> the note had said.</p><p>He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the
Cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only
moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.</p><p><i>Use it well.</i></p><p>Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open
to him in this Cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood
there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this,
anywhere, and Filch would never know.</p><p>Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held
him back &mdash; his father&rsquo;s Cloak &mdash; he felt that this
time &mdash; the first time &mdash; he wanted to use it alone.</p><p>He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the
common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; squawked the Fat Lady. Harry
said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.</p><p>Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.
And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library.
He&rsquo;d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took
to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility
Cloak tight around him as he walked.</p><p>The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to
see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was
floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm
supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.</p><p>The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.
Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from
the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the
titles.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold
letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn&rsquo;t understand.
Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that
looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry&rsquo;s
neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought
a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew
someone was there who shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on
the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an
interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught
his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very
heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.</p><p>A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence &mdash; the
book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on
and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward
and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he
heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside &mdash; stuffing
the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed
Filch in the doorway; Filch&rsquo;s pale, wild eyes looked straight
through him, and Harry slipped under Filch&rsquo;s outstretched arm
and streaked off up the corridor, the book&rsquo;s shrieks still
ringing in his ears.</p><p>He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He
had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn&rsquo;t
paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark,
he didn&rsquo;t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of
armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above
there.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if
anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody&rsquo;s been in
the library &mdash; Restricted Section.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was,
Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was
getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied,
&ldquo;The Restricted Section? Well, they can&rsquo;t be far,
we&rsquo;ll catch them.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around
the corner ahead. They couldn&rsquo;t see him, of course, but it
was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they&rsquo;d
knock right into him &mdash; the Cloak didn&rsquo;t stop him from
being solid.</p><p>He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his
left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his
breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get
inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked
straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply,
listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very
close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the
room he had hidden in.</p><p id="HP01CH12M03S">It looked like an unused classroom.
The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls,
and there was an upturned wastepaper basket &mdash; but propped
against the wall facing him was something that didn&rsquo;t look as
if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just
put it there to keep it out of the way.</p><p>It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an
ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an
inscription carved around the top: <i>Erised stra ehru oyt ube
cafru oyt on wohsi.</i></p><p>His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape,
Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but
see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.</p><p id="HP01CH12M03E">He had to clap his hands to his mouth
to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was
pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed &mdash;
for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd
of people standing right behind him.</p><p>But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly
back to the mirror.</p><p>There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and
there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked
over his shoulder &mdash; but still, no one was there. Or were they
all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible
people and this mirror&rsquo;s trick was that it reflected them,
invisible or not?</p><p>He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and
felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he&rsquo;d touch
her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air
&mdash; she and the others existed only in the mirror.</p><p>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes
&mdash; <i>her eyes are just like mine,</i> Harry thought, edging a
little closer to the glass. Bright green &mdash; exactly the same
shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying
at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to
her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very
untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry&rsquo;s did.</p><p>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly
touching that of his reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into
the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of
green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man
who looked as though he had Harry&rsquo;s knobbly knees &mdash;
Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his
life.</p><p>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily
back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he
was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a
powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible
sadness.</p><p>How long he stood there, he didn&rsquo;t know. The reflections
did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought
him back to his senses. He couldn&rsquo;t stay here, he had to find
his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother&rsquo;s
face, whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; and hurried
from the room.</p><p class="break">&ldquo;You could have woken me up,&rdquo; said
Ron, crossly.</p><p>&ldquo;You can come tonight, I&rsquo;m going back, I want to
show you the mirror.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see your mum and dad,&rdquo; Ron said
eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,
you&rsquo;ll be able to show me your other brothers and
everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can see them any old time,&rdquo; said Ron.
&ldquo;Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only
shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have
some bacon or something, why aren&rsquo;t you eating
anything?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t eat. He had seen his parents and would be
seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It
didn&rsquo;t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the
three-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole
it, really?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; said Ron. &ldquo;You look
odd.&rdquo;</p><p class="break">What Harry feared most was that he might not be
able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the Cloak,
too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried
retracing Harry&rsquo;s route from the library, wandering around
the dark passageways for nearly an hour.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing,&rdquo; said Ron. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
forget it and go back.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</i> Harry hissed. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s
here somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite
direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that
his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here &mdash; just here &mdash; yes!&rdquo;</p><p>They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the Cloak from around
his shoulders and ran to the mirror.</p><p>There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of
him.</p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Harry whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look! Look at them all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are
loads of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can only see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he
couldn&rsquo;t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley
pajamas.</p><p>Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you see all your family standing around
you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No &mdash; I&rsquo;m alone &mdash; but I&rsquo;m
different &mdash; I look older &mdash; and I&rsquo;m Head
Boy!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I am &mdash; I&rsquo;m wearing the badge like Bill used
to &mdash; and I&rsquo;m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch
Cup &mdash; I&rsquo;m Quidditch captain, too!&rdquo;</p><p>Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look
excitedly at Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think this mirror shows the future?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can it? All my family are dead &mdash; let me have
another look &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more
time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what&rsquo;s
interesting about that? I want to see my parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push me &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their
discussion. They hadn&rsquo;t realized how loudly they had been
talking.</p><p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p><p>Ron threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs.
Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both
thinking the same thing &mdash; did the Cloak work on cats? After
what seemed an age, she turned and left.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t safe &mdash; she might have gone for
Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.&rdquo;</p><p>And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.</p><p class="break">The snow still hadn&rsquo;t melted the next
morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to play chess, Harry?&rdquo; said Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go down and visit Hagrid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you
go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking about, Harry, that
mirror. Don&rsquo;t go back tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, I&rsquo;ve just got a bad feeling about it
&mdash; and anyway, you&rsquo;ve had too many close shaves already.
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they
can&rsquo;t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock
something over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound like Hermione.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, Harry, don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p><p>But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get
back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn&rsquo;t going to stop
him.</p><p class="break">That third night he found his way more quickly
than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more
noise than was wise, but he didn&rsquo;t meet anyone.</p><p>And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and
one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on
the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him
from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.</p><p>Except &mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So &mdash; back again, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked
behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other
than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so
desperate to get to the mirror he hadn&rsquo;t noticed him.</p><p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t see you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make
you,&rdquo; said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he
was smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit
on the floor with Harry, &ldquo;you, like hundreds before you, have
discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was called that, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I expect you&rsquo;ve realized by now what it
does?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It &mdash; well &mdash; it shows me my family
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head
Boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a cloak to become invisible,&rdquo;
said Dumbledore gently. &ldquo;Now, can you think what the Mirror
of Erised shows us all?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able
to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would
look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that
help?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry thought. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;It shows us what we
want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever we
want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; said Dumbledore quietly. &ldquo;It
shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate
desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see
them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been
overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best
of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge
or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they
have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real
or even possible.</p><p>&ldquo;The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,
and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever <i>do</i>
run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on
dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don&rsquo;t you
put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir &mdash; Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you
something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously, you&rsquo;ve just done so,&rdquo; Dumbledore
smiled. &ldquo;You may ask me one more thing, however.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you see when you look in the mirror?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen
socks.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stared.</p><p>&ldquo;One can never have enough socks,&rdquo; said Dumbledore.
&ldquo;Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn&rsquo;t get a
single pair. People will insist on giving me books.&rdquo;</p><p>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that
Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he
thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a
personal question.</p></body></html>
