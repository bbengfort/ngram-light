next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his
eyes shut tight.</p> <p>&ldquo;It was a dream,&rdquo; he told himself firmly. &ldquo;I
dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I&rsquo;ll be at home in my
cupboard.&rdquo;</p>    <p>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</p>   <p><i>And there&rsquo;s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,</i>
Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn&rsquo;t open
his eyes. It had been such a good dream.</p>    <p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>     <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Harry mumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
up.&rdquo;</p>    <p>He sat up and Hagrid&rsquo;s heavy coat fell off him. The hut
was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep
on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the
window, a newspaper held in its beak.</p>      <p>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large
balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and
jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top
of Hagrid, who didn&rsquo;t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto
the floor and began to attack Hagrid&rsquo;s coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its
beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid!&rdquo; said Harry loudly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an
owl &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pay him,&rdquo; Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He wants payin&rsquo; fer deliverin&rsquo; the paper.
Look in the pockets.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid&rsquo;s coat seemed to be made of nothing <i>but</i>
pockets &mdash; bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string,
peppermint humbugs, teabags&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. finally, Harry
pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.</p><p>&ldquo;Give him five Knuts,&rdquo; said Hagrid sleepily.</p><p>&ldquo;Knuts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The little bronze ones.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out
his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch
tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.</p><p>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</p><p>&ldquo;Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter
London an&rsquo; buy all yer stuff fer school.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He
had just thought of something that made him feel as though the
happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.</p><p>&ldquo;Um &mdash; Hagrid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo; said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge
boots.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any money &mdash; and you heard Uncle
Vernon last night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he won&rsquo;t pay for me to
go and learn magic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
standing up and scratching his head. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yeh think yer
parents didn&rsquo;t leave yeh anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But if their house was destroyed &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo; keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,
first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards&rsquo; bank. Have a
sausage, they&rsquo;re not bad cold &mdash; an&rsquo; I
wouldn&rsquo; say no teh a bit o&rsquo; yer birthday cake,
neither.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wizards have <i>banks</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Goblins?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah &mdash; so yeh&rsquo;d be mad ter try an&rsquo; rob
it, I&rsquo;ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry.
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want
ter keep safe &mdash;&rsquo;cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter
o&rsquo; fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore.
Hogwarts business.&rdquo; Hagrid drew himself up proudly. &ldquo;He
usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin&rsquo; you
&mdash; gettin&rsquo; things from Gringotts &mdash; knows he can
trust me, see.</p><p>&ldquo;Got everythin&rsquo;? Come on, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear
now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had
hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the
storm.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Harry asked, looking around
for another boat.</p><p>&ldquo;Flew,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Flew?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah &mdash; but we&rsquo;ll go back in this. Not
s&rsquo;pposed ter use magic now I&rsquo;ve got yeh.&rdquo;</p><p>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid,
trying to imagine him flying.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems a shame ter row, though,&rdquo; said Hagrid, giving
Harry another of his sideways looks. &ldquo;If I was ter &mdash; er
&mdash; speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin&rsquo;
it at Hogwarts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Harry, eager to see more
magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice
on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?&rdquo;
Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Spells &mdash; enchantments,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. &ldquo;They say there&rsquo;s
dragons guardin&rsquo; the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta
find yer way &mdash; Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London,
see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh&rsquo;d die of hunger
tryin&rsquo; ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands
on summat.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his
newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet.</i> Harry had learned from Uncle
Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but
it was very difficult, he&rsquo;d never had so many questions in
his life.</p><p>&ldquo;Ministry o&rsquo; Magic messin&rsquo; things up as
usual,&rdquo; Hagrid muttered, turning the page.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Ministry of Magic?&rdquo; Harry asked,
before he could stop himself.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;They wanted
Dumbledore fer Minister, o&rsquo; course, but he&rsquo;d never
leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever
there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,
askin&rsquo; fer advice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what does a Ministry of Magic <i>do</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that
there&rsquo;s still witches an&rsquo; wizards up an&rsquo; down the
country.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?</i> Blimey, Harry, everyone&rsquo;d be
wantin&rsquo; magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we&rsquo;re
best left alone.&rdquo;</p><p>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone
steps onto the street.</p><p>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the
little town to the station. Harry couldn&rsquo;t blame them. Not
only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at
perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly,
&ldquo;See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up,
eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid,&rdquo; said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to
keep up, &ldquo;did you say there are <i>dragons</i> at
Gringotts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, so they say,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;Crikey,
I&rsquo;d like a dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d <i>like</i> one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanted one ever since I was a kid &mdash; here we
go.&rdquo;</p><p>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in
five minutes&rsquo; time. Hagrid, who didn&rsquo;t understand
&ldquo;Muggle money,&rdquo; as he called it, gave the bills to
Harry so he could buy their tickets.</p><p>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two
seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus
tent.</p><p>&ldquo;Still got yer letter, Harry?&rdquo; he asked as he
counted stitches.</p><p>Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a list
there of everything yeh need.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn&rsquo;t noticed
the night before, and read:</p><div class="top"><div class="block"><div><p class="center">HOGWARTS SCHOOL</p><p class="center"><i>of</i> WITCHCRAFT <i>and</i> WIZARDRY</p><p class="center"><img src="images/swash.jpg" width="150" height="22" alt="swash"/></p><p class="noindent"><span class="sc">UNIFORM</span></p><p class="hang" style="margin-left: 1em">First-year students will require:</p><div class="block"><div><p class="hang" style="margin-left: 1em">1.

Harry wondered aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;If yeh know where to go,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p class="break">Harry had never been to London before. Although
Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used
to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket
barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats
were too small and the trains too slow.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the Muggles manage without
magic,&rdquo; he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that
led up to a bustling road lined with shops.</p><p>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry
had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and
music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that
looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be
piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really
shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be
some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry
hadn&rsquo;t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he
might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid
had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn&rsquo;t help
trusting him.</p><p>&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; said Hagrid, coming to a halt,
&ldquo;the Leaky Cauldron. It&rsquo;s a famous place.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn&rsquo;t
pointed it out, Harry wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it was there. The
people hurrying by didn&rsquo;t glance at it. Their eyes slid from
the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if
they couldn&rsquo;t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry
had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.</p><p>For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women
were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of
them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking
to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked
in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him,
and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, &ldquo;The usual,
Hagrid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, Tom, I&rsquo;m on Hogwarts business,&rdquo;
said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry&rsquo;s shoulder and
making Harry&rsquo;s knees buckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; said the bartender, peering at Harry,
&ldquo;is this &mdash; can this be &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p><p>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and
silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; whispered the old bartender,
&ldquo;Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what an honor.&rdquo;</p><p>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and
seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Everyone was looking at
him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without
realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.</p><p>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment,
Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky
Cauldron.</p><p>&ldquo;Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can&rsquo;t believe
I&rsquo;m meeting you at last.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So proud, Mr. Potter, I&rsquo;m just so proud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always wanted to shake your hand &mdash; I&rsquo;m all of
a flutter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can&rsquo;t tell you,
Diggle&rsquo;s the name, Dedalus Diggle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you before!&rdquo; said Harry, as Dedalus
Diggle&rsquo;s top hat fell off in his excitement. &ldquo;You bowed
to me once in a shop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He remembers!&rdquo; cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around
at everyone. &ldquo;Did you hear that? He remembers me!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shook hands again and again &mdash; Doris Crockford kept
coming back for more.</p><p>A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of
his eyes was twitching.</p><p>&ldquo;Professor Quirrell!&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;Harry,
Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at
Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;P-P-Potter,&rdquo; stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping
Harry&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;c-can&rsquo;t t-tell you how p-pleased I
am to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What sort of magic do you teach, Professor
Quirrell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,&rdquo; muttered
Professor Quirrell, as though he&rsquo;d rather not think about it.
&ldquo;N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?&rdquo; He laughed
nervously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be g-getting all your equipment, I
suppose? I&rsquo;ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
m-myself.&rdquo; He looked terrified at the very thought.</p><p>But the others wouldn&rsquo;t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry
to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.
At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.</p><p>&ldquo;Must get on &mdash; lots ter buy. Come on,
Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Doris Crockford shook Harry&rsquo;s hand one last time, and
Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled
courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few
weeds.</p><p>Hagrid grinned at Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Told yeh, didn&rsquo;t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even
Professor Quirrell was tremblin&rsquo; ter meet yeh &mdash; mind
you, he&rsquo;s usually tremblin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he always that nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while
he was studyin&rsquo; outta books but then he took a year off ter
get some first-hand experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They say he
met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit
o&rsquo; trouble with a hag &mdash; never been the same since.
Scared of the students, scared of his own subject &mdash; now,
where&rsquo;s me umbrella?&rdquo;</p><p>Vampires? Hags? Harry&rsquo;s head was swimming. Hagrid,
meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</p><p>&ldquo;Three up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two
across&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Right, stand
back, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his
umbrella.</p><p id="HP01CH05M01S">The brick he had touched quivered
&mdash; it wriggled &mdash; in the middle, a small hole appeared
&mdash; it grew wider and wider &mdash; a second later they were
facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a
cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; said Hagrid, &ldquo;to Diagon
Alley.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned at Harry&rsquo;s amazement. They stepped through the
archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway
shrink instantly back into solid wall.</p><p>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the
nearest shop. Cauldrons &mdash; All Sizes &mdash; Copper, Brass,
Pewter, Silver &mdash; Self-Stirring &mdash; Collapsible, said a
sign hanging over them.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; one,&rdquo; said
Hagrid, &ldquo;but we gotta get yer money first.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in
every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at
everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people
doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was
shaking her head as they passed, saying, &ldquo;Dragon liver,
sixteen Sickles an ounce, they&rsquo;re
mad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying
Eeylops Owl Emporium &mdash; Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and
Snowy. Several boys of about Harry&rsquo;s age had their noses
pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Harry heard one of them say, &ldquo;the new
Nimbus Two Thousand &mdash; fastest ever &mdash;&rdquo; There were
shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver
instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with
barrels of bat spleens and eels&rsquo; eyes, tottering piles of
spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes
of the moon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&ldquo;Gringotts,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the
other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors,
wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was &mdash;</p><p id="HP01CH05M01E">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a
goblin,&rdquo; said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than
Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry
noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked
inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this
time, with words engraved upon them:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>Enter, stranger, but take heed</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Of what awaits the sin of greed,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>For those who take, but do not earn,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Must pay most dearly in their turn.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>So if you seek beneath our floors</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>A treasure that was never yours,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Thief, you have been warned, beware</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Of finding more than treasure there.</i></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">&ldquo;Like I said, yeh&rsquo;d be mad ter try
an&rsquo; rob it,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p id="HP01CH05M02S">A pair of goblins bowed them through
the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a
hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long
counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass
scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were
too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins
were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for
the counter.</p><p id="HP01CH05M02E">&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said Hagrid to
a free goblin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come ter take some money outta
Mr. Harry Potter&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have his key, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it here somewhere,&rdquo; said Hagrid, and he started
emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of
moldy dog biscuits over the goblin&rsquo;s book of numbers. The
goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right
weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.</p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny
golden key.</p><p>The goblin looked at it closely.</p><p>&ldquo;That seems to be in order.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve also got a letter here from
Professor Dumbledore,&rdquo; said Hagrid importantly, throwing out
his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the You-Know-What in vault seven
hundred and thirteen.&rdquo;</p><p>The goblin read the letter carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, handing it back to Hagrid,
&ldquo;I will have someone take you down to both vaults.
Griphook!&rdquo;</p><p>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the
dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed
Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and
thirteen?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yeh that,&rdquo; said Hagrid
mysteriously. &ldquo;Very secret. Hogwarts business.
Dumbledore&rsquo;s trusted me. More&rsquo;n my job&rsquo;s worth
ter tell yeh that.&rdquo;</p><p>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected
more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway
lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were
little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small
cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in
&mdash; Hagrid with some difficulty &mdash; and were off.</p><p>At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork,
right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to
know its own way, because Griphook wasn&rsquo;t steering.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but
he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at
the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon,
but too late &mdash; they plunged even deeper, passing an
underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from
the ceiling and floor.</p><p>&ldquo;I never know,&rdquo; Harry called to Hagrid over the
noise of the cart, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the difference between a
stalagmite and a stalactite?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stalagmite&rsquo;s got an &lsquo;m&rsquo; in it,&rdquo;
said Hagrid. &ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo; ask me questions just now,
I think I&rsquo;m gonna be sick.&rdquo;</p><p>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside
a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean
against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</p><p>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing
out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold
coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</p><p>&ldquo;All yours,&rdquo; smiled Hagrid.</p><p>All Harry&rsquo;s &mdash; it was incredible. The Dursleys
couldn&rsquo;t have known about this or they&rsquo;d have had it
from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how
much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a
small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.</p><p>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</p><p>&ldquo;The gold ones are Galleons,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts
to a Sickle, it&rsquo;s easy enough. Right, that should be enough
fer a couple o&rsquo; terms, we&rsquo;ll keep the rest safe for
yeh.&rdquo; He turned to Griphook. &ldquo;Vault seven hundred and
thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One speed only,&rdquo; said Griphook.</p><p>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air
became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They
went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid
groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.</p><p>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</p><p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said Griphook importantly. He stroked
the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted
away.</p><p>&ldquo;If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they&rsquo;d
be sucked through the door and trapped in there,&rdquo; said
Griphook.</p><p>&ldquo;How often do you check to see if anyone&rsquo;s
inside?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;About once every ten years,&rdquo; said Griphook with a
rather nasty grin.</p><p>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top
security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly,
expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least &mdash; but at
first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little
package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked
it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what
it was, but knew better than to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don&rsquo;t talk
to me on the way back, it&rsquo;s best if I keep me mouth
shut,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p id="HP01CH05M03S" class="break">One wild cart ride later
they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry
didn&rsquo;t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of
money. He didn&rsquo;t have to know how many Galleons there were to
a pound to know that he was holding more money than he&rsquo;d had
in his whole life &mdash; more money than even Dudley had ever
had.</p><p>&ldquo;Might as well get yer uniform,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
nodding toward Madam Malkin&rsquo;s Robes for All Occasions.
&ldquo;Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts
carts.&rdquo; He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
Malkin&rsquo;s shop alone, feeling nervous.</p><p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in
mauve.</p><p>&ldquo;Hogwarts, dear?&rdquo; she said, when Harry started to
speak. &ldquo;Got the lot here &mdash; another young man being
fitted up just now, in fact.&rdquo;</p><p>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was
standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long
black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him,
slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right
length.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;Hogwarts,
too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s next door buying my books and
Mother&rsquo;s up the street looking at wands,&rdquo; said the boy.
He had a bored, drawling voice. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to drag
them off to look at racing brooms. I don&rsquo;t see why first
years can&rsquo;t have their own. I think I&rsquo;ll bully Father
into getting me one and I&rsquo;ll smuggle it in
somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.</p><p>&ldquo;Have <i>you</i> got your own broom?&rdquo; the boy went
on.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Play Quidditch at all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Harry said again, wondering what on earth
Quidditch could be.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> do &mdash; Father says it&rsquo;s a crime if
I&rsquo;m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree.
Know what House you&rsquo;ll be in yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry, feeling more stupid by the
minute.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they,
but I know I&rsquo;ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been
&mdash; imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I&rsquo;d leave,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; said Harry, wishing he could say something a
bit more interesting.</p><p>&ldquo;I say, look at that man!&rdquo; said the boy suddenly,
nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there,
grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he
couldn&rsquo;t come in.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Hagrid,&rdquo; said Harry, pleased to know
something the boy didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;He works at
Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him.
He&rsquo;s a sort of servant, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the gamekeeper,&rdquo; said Harry. He was
liking the boy less and less every second.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly. I heard he&rsquo;s a sort of <i>savage</i>
&mdash; lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then
he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his
bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s brilliant,&rdquo; said Harry
coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> you?&rdquo; said the boy, with a slight sneer.
&ldquo;Why is he with you? Where are your parents?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; said Harry shortly. He
didn&rsquo;t feel much like going into the matter with this
boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; said the other, not sounding sorry at
all. &ldquo;But they were <i>our</i> kind, weren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were a witch and wizard, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think they should let the other sort
in, do you? They&rsquo;re just not the same, they&rsquo;ve never
been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even
heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they
should keep it in the old wizarding families. What&rsquo;s your
surname, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you done, my dear,&rdquo; and Harry, not sorry
for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the
footstool.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,&rdquo;
said the drawling boy.</p><p>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought
him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment
and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink
that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he
said, &ldquo;Hagrid, what&rsquo;s Quidditch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin&rsquo; how little yeh
know &mdash; not knowin&rsquo; about Quidditch!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me feel worse,&rdquo; said Harry. He
told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; and he said people from Muggle families
shouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed in &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yer not <i>from</i> a Muggle family. If he&rsquo;d known
who yeh <i>were</i> &mdash; he&rsquo;s grown up knowin&rsquo; yer
name if his parents are wizardin&rsquo; folk. You saw what everyone
in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does
he know about it, some o&rsquo; the best I ever saw were the only
ones with magic in &rsquo;em in a long line o&rsquo; Muggles
&mdash; look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what <i>is</i> Quidditch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our sport. Wizard sport. It&rsquo;s like
&mdash; like soccer in the Muggle world &mdash; everyone follows
Quidditch &mdash; played up in the air on broomsticks and
there&rsquo;s four balls &mdash; sorta hard ter explain the
rules.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;School Houses. There&rsquo;s four. Everyone says
Hufflepuff are a lot o&rsquo; duffers, but &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet I&rsquo;m in Hufflepuff,&rdquo; said Harry
gloomily.</p><p>&ldquo;Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,&rdquo; said Hagrid
darkly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a single witch or wizard who went
bad who wasn&rsquo;t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vol-, sorry &mdash; You-Know-Who was at
Hogwarts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Years an&rsquo; years ago,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p>They bought Harry&rsquo;s school books in a shop called Flourish
and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books
as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of
postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols
and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never
read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of
these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from <i>Curses and
Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with
the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much,
Much More)</i> by Professor Vindictus Viridian.</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s not a good idea,
but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very
special circumstances,&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;An&rsquo; anyway,
yeh couldn&rsquo; work any of them curses yet, yeh&rsquo;ll need a
lot more study before yeh get ter that level.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid wouldn&rsquo;t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron,
either (&ldquo;It says pewter on yer list&rdquo;), but they got a
nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a
collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,
which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a
mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders
lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled
claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the
counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,
Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons
each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a
scoop).</p><p>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry&rsquo;s list
again.</p><p>&ldquo;Just yer wand left &mdash; oh yeah, an&rsquo; I still
haven&rsquo;t got yeh a birthday present.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt himself go red.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t have to. Tell yeh what, I&rsquo;ll
get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago,
yeh&rsquo;d be laughed at &mdash; an&rsquo; I don&rsquo; like cats,
they make me sneeze. I&rsquo;ll get yer an owl. All the kids want
owls, they&rsquo;re dead useful, carry yer mail an&rsquo;
everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had
been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl,
fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn&rsquo;t stop
stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.</p><p id="HP01CH05M03E">&ldquo;Don&rsquo; mention it,&rdquo;
said Hagrid gruffly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo; expect you&rsquo;ve had a
lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now
&mdash; only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the
best wand.&rdquo;</p><p>A magic wand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was what Harry had been
really looking forward to.</p><p>The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over
the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in
the dusty window.</p><p id="HP01CH05M04S">A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the
depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place,
empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to
wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict
library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred
to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled
neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his
neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle
with some secret magic.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said a soft voice. Harry jumped.
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching
noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.</p><p>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining
like moons through the gloom of the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Harry awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Yes, yes. I thought
I&rsquo;d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t
a question. &ldquo;You have your mother&rsquo;s eyes. It seems only
yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a
quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
work.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would
blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.</p><p>&ldquo;Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.
Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for
transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it &mdash;
it&rsquo;s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of
course.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost
nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty
eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry&rsquo;s
forehead with a long, white finger.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say I sold the wand that did
it,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew.
Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, if I&rsquo;d known what that wand
was going out into the world to do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head and then, to Harry&rsquo;s relief, spotted
Hagrid.</p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you
again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was, sir, yes,&rdquo; said Hagrid.</p><p>&ldquo;Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in
half when you got expelled?&rdquo; said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly
stern.</p><p>&ldquo;Er &mdash; yes, they did, yes,&rdquo; said Hagrid,
shuffling his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still got the pieces,
though,&rdquo; he added brightly.</p><p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t use them?&rdquo; said Mr. Ollivander
sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he
gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a
piercing look. &ldquo;Well, now &mdash; Mr. Potter. Let me
see.&rdquo; He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out
of his pocket. &ldquo;Which is your wand arm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er &mdash; well, I&rsquo;m right-handed,&rdquo; said
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold out your arm. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; He measured
Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to
floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said,
&ldquo;Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical
substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers,
and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the
same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the
same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
another wizard&rsquo;s wand.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was
measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr.
Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.</p><p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; he said, and the tape measure
crumpled into a heap on the floor. &ldquo;Right then, Mr. Potter.
Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice
and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit,
but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.</p><p>&ldquo;Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy.
Try &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry tried &mdash; but he had hardly raised the wand when it,
too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no &mdash; here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was
waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher
on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from
the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.</p><p>&ldquo;Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we&rsquo;ll find the
perfect match here somewhere &mdash; I wonder, now &mdash; yes, why
not &mdash; unusual combination &mdash; holly and phoenix feather,
eleven inches, nice and supple.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He
raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through
the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end
like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, &ldquo;Oh,
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well,
well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how very
curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>He put Harry&rsquo;s wand back into its box and wrapped it in
brown paper, still muttering, &ldquo;Curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s
curious?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember every wand I&rsquo;ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail
feather is in your wand, gave another feather &mdash; just one
other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for
this wand when its brother &mdash; why, its brother gave you that
scar.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swallowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how
these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard,
remember.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think we must expect great things
from you, Mr. Potter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After all,
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things &mdash; terrible, yes,
but great.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shivered. He wasn&rsquo;t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too
much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander
bowed them from his shop.</p><p id="HP01CH05M04E" class="break">The late afternoon sun
hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down
Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn&rsquo;t speak at all as they walked
down the road; he didn&rsquo;t even notice how much people were
gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all
their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage
on Harry&rsquo;s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington
station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him
on the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train
leaves,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats
to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so
strange, somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,&rdquo; said
Hagrid.</p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure he could explain. He&rsquo;d just had
the best birthday of his life &mdash; and yet &mdash; he chewed his
hamburger, trying to find the words.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone thinks I&rsquo;m special,&rdquo; he said at
last. &ldquo;All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor
Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I don&rsquo;t
know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things?
I&rsquo;m famous and I can&rsquo;t even remember what I&rsquo;m
famous for. I don&rsquo;t know what happened when Vol-, sorry
&mdash; I mean, the night my parents died.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and
eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; you worry, Harry. You&rsquo;ll learn fast
enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you&rsquo;ll
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it&rsquo;s hard. Yeh&rsquo;ve
been singled out, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s always hard. But
yeh&rsquo;ll have a great time at Hogwarts &mdash; I did &mdash;
still do, &rsquo;smatter of fact.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to
the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</p><p>&ldquo;Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First
o&rsquo; September &mdash; King&rsquo;s Cross &mdash; it&rsquo;s
all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter
with yer owl, she&rsquo;ll know where to find
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See yeh soon, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch
Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed
his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had
gone.</p></body></html>
