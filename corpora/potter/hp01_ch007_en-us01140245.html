once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood
there. She had a very stern face and Harry&rsquo;s first thought
was that this was not someone to cross.</p> <p>&ldquo;The firs&rsquo; years, Professor McGonagall,&rdquo; said
Hagrid.</p>    <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.&rdquo;</p>   <p id="HP01CH07M01S">She pulled the door wide. The entrance
hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys&rsquo;
house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the
ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a
magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper
floors.</p>    <p>They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone
floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a
doorway to the right &mdash; the rest of the school must already be
here &mdash; but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a
small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather
closer together than they would usually have done, peering about
nervously.</p>     <p>&ldquo;Welcome to Hogwarts,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall.
&ldquo;The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you
take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your
Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you
are here, your House will be something like your family within
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep
in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common
room.</p>    <p>&ldquo;The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and
each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at
Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any
rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the
House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor.
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes
yours.</p>      <p>&ldquo;The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in
front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten
yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville&rsquo;s cloak, which
was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron&rsquo;s smudged nose.
Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall return when we are ready for you,&rdquo; said
Professor McGonagall. &ldquo;Please wait quietly.&rdquo;</p><p>She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.</p><p>&ldquo;How exactly do they sort us into Houses?&rdquo; he asked
Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but
I think he was joking.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of
the whole school? But he didn&rsquo;t know any magic yet &mdash;
what on earth would he have to do? He hadn&rsquo;t expected
something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around
anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one
was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very
fast about all the spells she&rsquo;d learned and wondering which
one she&rsquo;d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her.
He&rsquo;d never been more nervous, never, not even when he&rsquo;d
had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that
he&rsquo;d somehow turned his teacher&rsquo;s wig blue. He kept his
eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would
come back and lead him to his doom.</p><p>Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the
air &mdash; several people behind him screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;What the &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p><p>He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had
just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly
transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and
hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What
looked like a fat little monk was saying: &ldquo;Forgive and
forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Friar, haven&rsquo;t we given Peeves all the
chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know,
he&rsquo;s not really even a ghost &mdash; I say, what are you all
doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first
years.</p><p>Nobody answered.</p><p>&ldquo;New students!&rdquo; said the Fat Friar, smiling around
at them. &ldquo;About to be Sorted, I suppose?&rdquo;</p><p>A few people nodded mutely.</p><p>&ldquo;Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!&rdquo; said the Friar.
&ldquo;My old House, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Move along now,&rdquo; said a sharp voice. &ldquo;The
Sorting Ceremony&rsquo;s about to start.&rdquo;</p><p>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts
floated away through the opposite wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, form a line,&rdquo; Professor McGonagall told the
first years, &ldquo;and follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got
into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and
they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a
pair of double doors into the Great Hall.</p><p id="HP01CH07M01E">Harry had never even imagined such a
strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands
of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables,
where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid
with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall
was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt
in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in
the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the
students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the
staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling
dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in
<i>Hogwarts: A History.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and
that the Great Hall didn&rsquo;t simply open on to the heavens.</p><p id="HP01CH07M02S">Harry quickly looked down again as
Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front
of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed
wizard&rsquo;s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely
dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn&rsquo;t have let it in the house.</p><p><i>Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it,</i> Harry
thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing &mdash; noticing that
everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it,
too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat
twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth &mdash; and
the hat began to sing:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>&ldquo;Oh, you may not think I&rsquo;m pretty,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>But don&rsquo;t judge on what you see,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>I&rsquo;ll eat myself if you can find</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>A smarter hat than me.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>You can keep your bowlers black,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Your top hats sleek and tall,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>For I&rsquo;m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>And I can cap them all.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>There&rsquo;s nothing hidden in your head</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>The Sorting Hat can&rsquo;t see,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>So try me on and I will tell you</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Where you ought to be.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>You might belong in Gryffindor,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Where dwell the brave at heart,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Set Gryffindors apart;</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>You might belong in Hufflepuff,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Where they are just and loyal,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>And unafraid of toil;</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>If you&rsquo;ve a ready mind,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Where those of wit and learning,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Will always find their kind;</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Or perhaps in Slytherin</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>You&rsquo;ll make your real friends,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Those cunning folk use any means</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>To achieve their ends.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>So put me on! Don&rsquo;t be afraid!</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>And don&rsquo;t get in a flap!</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>You&rsquo;re in safe hands (though I have none)</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>For I&rsquo;m a Thinking Cap!&rdquo;</i></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">The whole hall burst into applause as the hat
finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then
became quite still again.</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ve just got to try on the hat!&rdquo; Ron
whispered to Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill Fred, he was going on
about wrestling a troll.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better
than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it
on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a
lot; Harry didn&rsquo;t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at
the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.</p><p>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment.</p><p>&ldquo;When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on
the stool to be sorted,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Abbott,
Hannah!&rdquo;</p><p>A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put
on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A
moment&rsquo;s pause &mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;HUFFLEPUFF!&rdquo; shouted the hat.</p><p>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit
down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar
waving merrily at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Bones, Susan!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HUFFLEPUFF!&rdquo; shouted the hat again, and Susan
scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.</p><p>&ldquo;Boot, Terry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;RAVENCLAW!&rdquo;</p><p>The table second from the left clapped this time; several
Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined
them.</p><p>&ldquo;Brocklehurst, Mandy&rdquo; went to Ravenclaw too, but
&ldquo;Brown, Lavender&rdquo; became the first new Gryffindor, and
the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see
Ron&rsquo;s twin brothers catcalling.</p><p>&ldquo;Bulstrode, Millicent&rdquo; then became a Slytherin.
Perhaps it was Harry&rsquo;s imagination, after all he&rsquo;d
heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an
unpleasant lot.</p><p>He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being
picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been
last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one
wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Finch-Fletchley, Justin!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HUFFLEPUFF!&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once,
but at others it took a little while to decide. &ldquo;Finnigan,
Seamus,&rdquo; the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat
on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him
a Gryffindor.</p><p>&ldquo;Granger, Hermione!&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on
her head.</p><p>&ldquo;GRYFFINDOR!&rdquo; shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</p><p>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do
when you&rsquo;re very nervous. What if he wasn&rsquo;t chosen at
all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages,
until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there
had obviously been a mistake and he&rsquo;d better get back on the
train?</p><p>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was
called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long
time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted,
&ldquo;GRYFFINDOR,&rdquo; Neville ran off still wearing it, and had
to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to &ldquo;MacDougal,
Morag.&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his
wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,
&ldquo;SLYTHERIN!&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking
pleased with himself.</p><p>There weren&rsquo;t many people left now.</p><p>&ldquo;Moon&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,
&ldquo;Nott&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,
&ldquo;Parkinson&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then a pair of twin
girls, &ldquo;Patil&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Patil&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then &ldquo;Perks,
Sally-Anne&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , and then, at last
&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Potter, Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like
little hissing fires all over the hall.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Potter,</i> did she say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> Harry Potter?&rdquo;</p><p>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes
was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next
second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He
waited.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; said a small voice in his ear.
&ldquo;Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a
bad mind either. There&rsquo;s talent, oh my goodness, yes &mdash;
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that&rsquo;s
interesting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So where shall I put
you?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, <i>Not
Slytherin, not Slytherin.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Not Slytherin, eh?&rdquo; said the small voice.
&ldquo;Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it&rsquo;s all
here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to
greatness, no doubt about that &mdash; no? Well, if you&rsquo;re
sure &mdash; better be GRYFFINDOR!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He
took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He
was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he
hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the
Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley
twins yelled, &ldquo;We got Potter! We got Potter!&rdquo; Harry sat
down opposite the ghost in the ruff he&rsquo;d seen earlier. The
ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling
he&rsquo;d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.</p><p id="HP01CH07M02E">He could see the High Table properly
now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave
him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of
the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry
recognized him at once from the card he&rsquo;d gotten out of the
Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore&rsquo;s silver hair was the
only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from
the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
turban.</p><p>And now there were only four people left to be sorted.
&ldquo;Thomas, Dean,&rdquo; a black boy even taller than Ron,
joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. &ldquo;Turpin, Lisa,&rdquo;
became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron&rsquo;s turn. He was pale
green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat had shouted, &ldquo;GRYFFINDOR!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the
chair next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Ron, excellent,&rdquo; said Percy Weasley
pompously across Harry as &ldquo;Zabini, Blaise,&rdquo; was made a
Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the
Sorting Hat away.</p><p>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just
realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages
ago.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the
students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased
him more than to see them all there.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Welcome to a new year at
Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few
words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry
didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he &mdash; a bit mad?&rdquo; he asked Percy
uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Mad?&rdquo; said Percy airily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes.
Potatoes, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were
now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to
eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb
chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,
fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for
some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</p><p>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he&rsquo;d
never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always
taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick.
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the
peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</p><p>&ldquo;That does look good,&rdquo; said the ghost in the ruff
sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten for nearly five hundred
years,&rdquo; said the ghost. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to, of
course, but one does miss it. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve
introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your
service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know who you are!&rdquo; said Ron suddenly. &ldquo;My
brothers told me about you &mdash; you&rsquo;re Nearly Headless
Nick!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would <i>prefer</i> you to call me Sir Nicholas de
Mimsy &mdash;&rdquo; the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired
Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nearly</i> Headless? How can you be <i>nearly</i>
headless?&rdquo;</p><p>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat
wasn&rsquo;t going at all the way he wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Like <i>this,</i>&rdquo; he said irritably. He seized his
left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell
onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously
tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at
the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his
head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, &ldquo;So &mdash; new
Gryffindors! I hope you&rsquo;re going to help us win the House
Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without
winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody
Baron&rsquo;s becoming almost unbearable &mdash; he&rsquo;s the
Slytherin ghost.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible
ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and
robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who,
Harry was pleased to see, didn&rsquo;t look too pleased with the
seating arrangements.</p><p>&ldquo;How did he get covered in blood?&rdquo; asked Seamus with
great interest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never asked,&rdquo; said Nearly Headless Nick
delicately.</p><p>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of
the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as
before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream
in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts,
chocolate &eacute;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries,
Jell-O, rice pudding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to
their families.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half-and-half,&rdquo; said Seamus. &ldquo;Me
dad&rsquo;s a Muggle. Mum didn&rsquo;t tell him she was a witch
&rsquo;til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for
him.&rdquo;</p><p>The others laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;What about you, Neville?&rdquo; said Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my gran brought me up and she&rsquo;s a
witch,&rdquo; said Neville, &ldquo;but the family thought I was
all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me
off my guard and force some magic out of me &mdash; he pushed me
off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned &mdash; but
nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round
for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the
ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he
accidentally let go. But I bounced &mdash; all the way down the
garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was
crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when
I got in here &mdash; they thought I might not be magic enough to
come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my
toad.&rdquo;</p><p>On Harry&rsquo;s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were
talking about lessons (&ldquo;I <i>do</i> hope they start right
away, there&rsquo;s so much to learn, I&rsquo;m particularly
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into
something else, of course, it&rsquo;s supposed to be very difficult
&mdash;&rdquo;; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be starting small, just matches
into needles and that sort of thing &mdash;&rdquo;).</p><p>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at
the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with
greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.</p><p>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past
Quirrell&rsquo;s turban straight into Harry&rsquo;s eyes &mdash;
and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry&rsquo;s
forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; Harry clapped a hand to his head.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Percy.</p><p>&ldquo;N-nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off
was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher&rsquo;s look
&mdash; a feeling that he didn&rsquo;t like Harry at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that teacher talking to Professor
Quirrell?&rdquo; he asked Percy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder
he&rsquo;s looking so nervous, that&rsquo;s Professor Snape. He
teaches Potions, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to &mdash; everyone
knows he&rsquo;s after Quirrell&rsquo;s job. Knows an awful lot
about the Dark Arts, Snape.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn&rsquo;t look at
him again.</p><p>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore
got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahem &mdash; just a few more words now that we are all
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give
you.</p><p>&ldquo;First years should note that the forest on the grounds is
forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do
well to remember that as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Dumbledore&rsquo;s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of
the Weasley twins.</p><p>&ldquo;I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to
remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the
corridors.</p><p>&ldquo;Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the
term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should
contact Madam Hooch.</p><p>&ldquo;And finally, I must tell you that this year, the
third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to
everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not serious?&rdquo; he muttered to Percy.</p><p>&ldquo;Must be,&rdquo; said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why
we&rsquo;re not allowed to go somewhere &mdash; the forest&rsquo;s
full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school
song!&rdquo; cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other
teachers&rsquo; smiles had become rather fixed.</p><p>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to
get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it,
which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike,
into words.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone pick their favorite tune,&rdquo; said
Dumbledore, &ldquo;and off we go!&rdquo;</p><p>And the school bellowed:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>&ldquo;Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty
Hogwarts,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Teach us something please,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Whether we be old and bald</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Or young with scabby knees,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Our heads could do with filling</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>With some interesting stuff,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>For now they&rsquo;re bare and full of air,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Dead flies and bits of fluff,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>So teach us things worth knowing,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Bring back what we&rsquo;ve forgot,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Just do your best, we&rsquo;ll do the rest,</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>And learn until our brains all rot.&rdquo;</i></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Everybody finished the song at different times.
At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very
slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with
his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who
clapped loudest.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, music,&rdquo; he said, wiping his eyes. &ldquo;A
magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you
trot!&rdquo;</p><p>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering
crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.
Harry&rsquo;s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so
tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that
the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and
pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through
doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They
climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry
was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came
to a sudden halt.</p><p>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them,
and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing
themselves at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Peeves,&rdquo; Percy whispered to the first years.
&ldquo;A poltergeist.&rdquo; He raised his voice, &ldquo;Peeves
&mdash; show yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon,
answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a
wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching
the walking sticks.</p><p>&ldquo;Oooooooh!&rdquo; he said, with an evil cackle.
&ldquo;Ickle Firsties! What fun!&rdquo;</p><p>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, Peeves, or the Baron&rsquo;ll hear about this, I
mean it!&rdquo; barked Percy.</p><p>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking
sticks on Neville&rsquo;s head. They heard him zooming away,
rattling coats of armor as he passed.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to watch out for Peeves,&rdquo; said Percy, as
they set off again. &ldquo;The Bloody Baron&rsquo;s the only one
who can control him, he won&rsquo;t even listen to us prefects.
Here we are.&rdquo;</p><p>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat
woman in a pink silk dress.</p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; she said.</p><p id="HP01CH07M03S">&ldquo;Caput Draconis,&rdquo; said
Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the
wall. They all scrambled through it &mdash; Neville needed a leg up
&mdash; and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy,
round room full of squashy armchairs.</p><p id="HP01CH07M03E">Percy directed the girls through one
door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of
a spiral staircase &mdash; they were obviously in one of the towers
&mdash; they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with
deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought
up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell
into bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Great food, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Ron muttered to Harry
through the hangings. &ldquo;Get <i>off,</i> Scabbers! He&rsquo;s
chewing my sheets.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was going to ask Ron if he&rsquo;d had any of the treacle
tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</p><p>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very
strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell&rsquo;s turban,
which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to
Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the
turban he didn&rsquo;t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and
heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully &mdash;
and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it
&mdash; then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape,
whose laugh became high and cold &mdash; there was a burst of green
light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</p><p>He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day,
he didn&rsquo;t remember the dream at all.</p></body></html>
