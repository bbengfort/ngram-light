the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe
to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors
again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn&rsquo;t, because he was
trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.</p>      <p id="HP01CH08M01S">There were a hundred and forty-two
staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones;
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a
vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then
there were doors that wouldn&rsquo;t open unless you asked
politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
that weren&rsquo;t really doors at all, but solid walls just
pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was,
because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the
coats of armor could walk.</p><p>The ghosts didn&rsquo;t help, either. It was always a nasty
shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were
trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new
Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was
worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when
you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your
head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk,
or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech,
&ldquo;GOT YOUR CONK!&rdquo;</p><p>Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker,
Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him
on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their
way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to
the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn&rsquo;t
believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it
on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when
they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.</p><p>Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored
creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch&rsquo;s. She
patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put
just one toe out of line, and she&rsquo;d whisk off for Filch,
who&rsquo;d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the
secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps
the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the
ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition
of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.</p><p>And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the
classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly
found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.</p><p>They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and
the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to
the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy
little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to
take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what
they were used for.</p><p>Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the
only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and
got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns
droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got
Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.</p><p>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard
who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the
start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he
reached Harry&rsquo;s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled
out of sight.</p><p>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite
right to think she wasn&rsquo;t a teacher to cross. Strict and
clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her
first class.</p><p>&ldquo;Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous
magic you will learn at Hogwarts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anyone
messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have
been warned.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were
all very impressed and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get started, but soon
realized they weren&rsquo;t going to be changing the furniture into
animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes,
they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a
needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made
any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class
how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare
smile.</p><p>The class everyone had really been looking forward to was
Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell&rsquo;s lessons turned
out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of
garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he&rsquo;d
met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one
of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by
an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome
zombie, but they weren&rsquo;t sure they believed this story. For
one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking
about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell
hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was
stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected
wherever he went.</p><p>Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn&rsquo;t miles
behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families
and, like him, hadn&rsquo;t had any idea that they were witches and
wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron
didn&rsquo;t have much of a head start.</p><p id="HP01CH08M01E">Friday was an important day for Harry
and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great
Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.</p><p>&ldquo;What have we got today?&rdquo; Harry asked Ron as he
poured sugar on his porridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Double Potions with the Slytherins,&rdquo; said Ron.
&ldquo;Snape&rsquo;s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always
favors them &mdash; we&rsquo;ll be able to see if it&rsquo;s
true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wish McGonagall favored us,&rdquo; said Harry. Professor
McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn&rsquo;t
stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day
before.</p><p>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by
now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning,
when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall
during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners,
and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.</p><p>Hedwig hadn&rsquo;t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes
flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off
to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning,
however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry&rsquo;s plate. Harry tore it
open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:</p><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>Dear Harry,</i></p><p class="indent"><i>I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would
you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want
to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig.</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Hagrid</i></p></div></div><p class="noindent">Harry borrowed Ron&rsquo;s quill, scribbled
<i>Yes, please, see you later</i> on the back of the note, and sent
Hedwig off again.</p><p>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to,
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that
had happened to him so far.</p><p>At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that
Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions
lesson, he knew he&rsquo;d been wrong. Snape didn&rsquo;t dislike
Harry &mdash; he <i>hated</i> him.</p><p id="HP01CH08M02S">Potions lessons took place down in one
of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and
would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals
floating in glass jars all around the walls.</p><p>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call,
and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry&rsquo;s name.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;Harry Potter. Our
new &mdash; <i>celebrity</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind
their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the
class. His eyes were black like Hagrid&rsquo;s, but they had none
of Hagrid&rsquo;s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you
think of dark tunnels.</p><p>&ldquo;You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potion-making,&rdquo; he began. He spoke in barely more than a
whisper, but they caught every word &mdash; like Professor
McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without
effort. &ldquo;As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of
you will hardly believe this is magic. I don&rsquo;t expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron
with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep
through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the
senses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can teach you how to bottle fame,
brew glory, even stopper death &mdash; if you aren&rsquo;t as big a
bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.&rdquo;</p><p>More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron
exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the
edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she
wasn&rsquo;t a dunderhead.</p><p>&ldquo;Potter!&rdquo; said Snape suddenly. &ldquo;What would I
get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of
wormwood?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Powdered root of what to an infusion of what?</i> Harry
glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione&rsquo;s
hand had shot into the air.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>Snape&rsquo;s lips curled into a sneer.</p><p>&ldquo;Tut, tut &mdash; fame clearly isn&rsquo;t
everything.&rdquo;</p><p>He ignored Hermione&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try again. Potter, where would you look if I
told you to find me a bezoar?&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go
without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn&rsquo;t have the
faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thought you wouldn&rsquo;t open a book before coming, eh,
Potter?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold
eyes. He <i>had</i> looked through his books at the
Dursleys&rsquo;, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in
<i>One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi</i>?</p><p>Snape was still ignoring Hermione&rsquo;s quivering hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and
wolfsbane?&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the
dungeon ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Harry quietly. &ldquo;I
think Hermione does, though, why don&rsquo;t you try
her?&rdquo;</p><p>A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus&rsquo;s eye, and
Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he snapped at Hermione. &ldquo;For your
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion
so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is
a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why
aren&rsquo;t you all copying that down?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the
noise, Snape said, &ldquo;And a point will be taken from Gryffindor
House for your cheek, Potter.&rdquo;</p><p>Things didn&rsquo;t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions
lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to
mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his
long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake
fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to
like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way
Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke
and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed
to melt Seamus&rsquo;s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their
potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in
people&rsquo;s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing
on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion
when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils
sprang up all over his arms and legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Idiot boy!&rdquo; snarled Snape, clearing the spilled
potion away with one wave of his wand. &ldquo;I suppose you added
the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the
fire?&rdquo;</p><p>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his
nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Take him up to the hospital wing,&rdquo; Snape spat at
Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next
to Neville.</p><p>&ldquo;You &mdash; Potter &mdash; why didn&rsquo;t you tell him
not to add the quills? Thought he&rsquo;d make you look good if he
got it wrong, did you? That&rsquo;s another point you&rsquo;ve lost
for Gryffindor.&rdquo;</p><p>This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron
kicked him behind their cauldron.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push it,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH08M02E">As they climbed the steps out of the
dungeon an hour later, Harry&rsquo;s mind was racing and his
spirits were low. He&rsquo;d lost two points for Gryffindor in his
very first week &mdash; <i>why</i> did Snape hate him so much?</p><p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said Ron, &ldquo;Snape&rsquo;s always
taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with
you?&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH08M03S">At five to three they left the castle
and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small
wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a
pair of galoshes were outside the front door.</p><p>When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside
and several booming barks. Then Hagrid&rsquo;s voice rang out,
saying, &ldquo;<i>Back,</i> Fang &mdash; <i>back.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid&rsquo;s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he
pulled the door open.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>Back,</i>
Fang.&rdquo;</p><p>He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an
enormous black boarhound.</p><p id="HP01CH08M03E">There was only one room inside. Hams
and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was
boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed
with a patchwork quilt over it.</p><p>&ldquo;Make yerselves at home,&rdquo; said Hagrid, letting go of
Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.
Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Ron,&rdquo; Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a
plate.</p><p>&ldquo;Another Weasley, eh?&rdquo; said Hagrid, glancing at
Ron&rsquo;s freckles. &ldquo;I spent half me life chasin&rsquo; yer
twin brothers away from the forest.&rdquo;</p><p>The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost
broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them
as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his
head on Harry&rsquo;s knee and drooled all over his robes.</p><p>Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch
&ldquo;that old git.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I&rsquo;d like
ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D&rsquo;yeh know, every time I
go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can&rsquo;t get
rid of her &mdash; Filch puts her up to it.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry told Hagrid about Snape&rsquo;s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron,
told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of
the students.</p><p>&ldquo;But he seemed to really <i>hate</i> me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;Why should
he?&rdquo;</p><p>Yet Harry couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that Hagrid didn&rsquo;t
quite meet his eyes when he said that.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s yer brother Charlie?&rdquo; Hagrid asked Ron.
&ldquo;I liked him a lot &mdash; great with animals.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie&rsquo;s work with dragons,
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under
the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the <i>Daily Prophet:</i></p><div class="top"><p class="center" style="font-family:sans-serif;"><b>GRINGOTTS
BREAK-IN LATEST</b></p></div><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent">Investigations continue into the break-in at
Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark
wizards or witches unknown.</p><p>Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had
been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
the same day.</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not telling you what was
in there, so keep your noses out if you know what&rsquo;s good for
you,&rdquo; said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.</p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train
that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn&rsquo;t
mentioned the date.</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid!&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;that Gringotts break-in
happened on my birthday! It might&rsquo;ve been happening while we
were there!&rdquo;</p><p>There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn&rsquo;t meet
Harry&rsquo;s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another
rock cake. Harry read the story again. <i>The vault that was
searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.</i> Hagrid
had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it
emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what
the thieves were looking for?</p><p>As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they&rsquo;d been too polite
to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he&rsquo;d had so
far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had
Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And
did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn&rsquo;t want to
tell Harry?</p></body></html>
