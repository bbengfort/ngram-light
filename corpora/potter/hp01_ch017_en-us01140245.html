His face wasn&rsquo;t twitching at all.</p>   <p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;I wondered whether
I&rsquo;d be meeting you here, Potter.&rdquo;</p>    <p>&ldquo;But I thought &mdash; Snape &mdash;&rdquo;</p>     <p>&ldquo;Severus?&rdquo; Quirrell laughed, and it wasn&rsquo;t his
usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. &ldquo;Yes,
Severus does seem the type, doesn&rsquo;t he? So useful to have him
swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would
suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?&rdquo;</p>    <p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t take it in. This couldn&rsquo;t be true, it
couldn&rsquo;t.</p>      <p>&ldquo;But Snape tried to kill me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no. <i>I</i> tried to kill you. Your friend Miss
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to
Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you.
Another few seconds and I&rsquo;d have got you off that broom.
I&rsquo;d have managed it before then if Snape hadn&rsquo;t been
muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Snape was trying to <i>save</i> me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Quirrell coolly. &ldquo;Why do you
think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make
sure I didn&rsquo;t do it again. Funny, really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
he needn&rsquo;t have bothered. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything with
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was
trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he <i>did</i> make himself
unpopular&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what a waste of time, when after
all that, I&rsquo;m going to kill you tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and
wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around
the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you&rsquo;d seen
me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> let the troll in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls &mdash; you
must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?
Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for
it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third
floor to head me off &mdash; and not only did my troll fail to beat
you to death, that three-headed dog didn&rsquo;t even manage to
bite Snape&rsquo;s leg off properly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this
interesting mirror.&rdquo;</p><p>It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind
Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.</p><p>&ldquo;This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,&rdquo;
Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. &ldquo;Trust
Dumbledore to come up with something like this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but he&rsquo;s in London&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;ll be far
away by the time he gets back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and
stop him from concentrating on the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw you and Snape in the forest &mdash;&rdquo; he
blurted out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror
to look at the back. &ldquo;He was on to me by that time, trying to
find out how far I&rsquo;d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to
frighten me &mdash; as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort
on my side.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared
hungrily into it.</p><p>&ldquo;I see the Stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;m presenting
it to my master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but where is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they
didn&rsquo;t give. He <i>had</i> to keep Quirrell from giving his
whole attention to the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he does,&rdquo; said Quirrell casually,
&ldquo;heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father,
didn&rsquo;t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted
you <i>dead.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing &mdash; I thought
Snape was threatening you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across
Quirrell&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I find it hard to
follow my master&rsquo;s instructions &mdash; he is a great wizard
and I am weak &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean he was there in the classroom with you?&rdquo;
Harry gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;He is with me wherever I go,&rdquo; said Quirrell
quietly. &ldquo;I met him when I traveled around the world. A
foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good
and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no
good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since then, I have served him faithfully,
although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard
on me.&rdquo; Quirrell shivered suddenly. &ldquo;He does not
forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from
Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. decided he would have to keep a closer
watch on me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell&rsquo;s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his
trip to Diagon Alley &mdash; how could he have been so stupid?
He&rsquo;d <i>seen</i> Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands
with him in the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>Quirrell cursed under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the
Stone <i>inside</i> the mirror? Should I break it?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s mind was racing.</p><p><i>What I want more than anything else in the world at the
moment,</i> he thought<i>, is to find the Stone before Quirrell
does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it
&mdash; which means I&rsquo;ll see where it&rsquo;s hidden! But how
can I look without Quirrell realizing what I&rsquo;m up to?</i></p><p>He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too
tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still
talking to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me,
Master!&rdquo;</p><p>And to Harry&rsquo;s horror, a voice answered, and the voice
seemed to come from Quirrell himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Use the boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Use the
boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell rounded on Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; Potter &mdash; come here.&rdquo;</p><p>He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.
Harry got slowly to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Quirrell repeated. &ldquo;Look in the
mirror and tell me what you see.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry walked toward him.</p><p><i>I must lie,</i> he thought desperately. <i>I must look and
lie about what I see, that&rsquo;s all.</i></p><p>Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny
smell that seemed to come from Quirrell&rsquo;s turban. He closed
his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them
again.</p><p id="HP01CH17M01S">He saw his reflection, pale and
scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled
at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red
stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket &mdash; and
as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket.
Somehow &mdash; incredibly &mdash; <i>he&rsquo;d gotten the
Stone.</i></p><p id="HP01CH17M01E">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Quirrell
impatiently. &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry screwed up his courage.</p><p>&ldquo;I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,&rdquo; he
invented. &ldquo;I &mdash; I&rsquo;ve won the House Cup for
Gryffindor.&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell cursed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of the way,&rdquo; he said. As Harry moved aside,
he felt the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a
break for it?</p><p>But he hadn&rsquo;t walked five paces before a high voice spoke,
though Quirrell wasn&rsquo;t moving his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;He lies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He
lies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Potter, come back here!&rdquo; Quirrell shouted.
&ldquo;Tell me the truth! What did you just see?&rdquo;</p><p>The high voice spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me speak to him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
face-to-face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Master, you are not strong enough!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have strength enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for
this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt as if Devil&rsquo;s Snare was rooting him to the
spot. He couldn&rsquo;t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as
Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going
on? The turban fell away. Quirrell&rsquo;s head looked strangely
small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.</p><p>Harry would have screamed, but he couldn&rsquo;t make a sound.
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell&rsquo;s head, there
was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was
chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a
snake.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; it
whispered.</p><p>Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn&rsquo;t
move.</p><p>&ldquo;See what I have become?&rdquo; the face said. &ldquo;Mere
shadow and vapor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have form only when I can
share another&rsquo;s body&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there have
always been those willing to let me into their hearts and
minds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Unicorn blood has strengthened me,
these past weeks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you saw faithful Quirrell
drinking it for me in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and once I
have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my
own.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why don&rsquo;t
you give me that Stone in your pocket?&rdquo;</p><p>So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry&rsquo;s
legs. He stumbled backward.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; snarled the face.
&ldquo;Better save your own life and join me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or you&rsquo;ll meet the same end as your
parents.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They died begging me for
mercy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;LIAR!&rdquo; Harry shouted suddenly.</p><p>Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could
still see him. The evil face was now smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;How touching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; it hissed.
&ldquo;I always value bravery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, boy, your
parents were brave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I killed your father
first, and he put up a courageous fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
your mother needn&rsquo;t have died&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was
trying to protect you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now give me the Stone,
unless you want her to have died in vain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NEVER!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed
&ldquo;SEIZE HIM!&rdquo; and the next second, Harry felt
Quirrell&rsquo;s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp
pain seared across Harry&rsquo;s scar; his head felt as though it
was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his
might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his
head lessened &mdash; he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell
had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers
&mdash; they were blistering before his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Seize him! SEIZE HIM!&rdquo; shrieked Voldemort again,
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on
top of him, both hands around Harry&rsquo;s neck &mdash;
Harry&rsquo;s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could
see Quirrell howling in agony.</p><p>&ldquo;Master, I cannot hold him &mdash; my hands &mdash; my
hands!&rdquo;</p><p>And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees,
let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms &mdash;
Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.</p><p>&ldquo;Then kill him, fool, and be done!&rdquo; screeched
Voldemort.</p><p>Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry,
by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell&rsquo;s face
&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;AAAARGH!&rdquo;</p><p>Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then
Harry knew: Quirrell couldn&rsquo;t touch his bare skin, not
without suffering terrible pain &mdash; his only chance was to keep
hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a
curse.</p><p>Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung
on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry
off &mdash; the pain in Harry&rsquo;s head was building &mdash; he
couldn&rsquo;t see &mdash; he could only hear Quirrell&rsquo;s
terrible shrieks and Voldemort&rsquo;s yells of, &ldquo;KILL HIM!
KILL HIM!&rdquo; and other voices, maybe in Harry&rsquo;s own head,
crying, &ldquo;Harry! Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>He felt Quirrell&rsquo;s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all
was lost, and fell into blackness, down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p class="break">Something gold was glinting just above him. The
Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.</p><p>He blinked. It wasn&rsquo;t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of
glasses. How strange.</p><p>He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into
view above him.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Harry,&rdquo; said Dumbledore.</p><p>Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: &ldquo;Sir! The Stone!
It was Quirrell! He&rsquo;s got the Stone! Sir, quick
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the
times,&rdquo; said Dumbledore. &ldquo;Quirrell does not have the
Stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then who does? Sir, I &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown
out.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in
the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets,
and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half
the candy shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Tokens from your friends and admirers,&rdquo; said
Dumbledore, beaming. &ldquo;What happened down in the dungeons
between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so,
naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters
Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a
toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam
Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and
confiscated it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long have I been in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be
most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely
worried.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But sir, the Stone &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone.
Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in
time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your
own, I must say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got there? You got Hermione&rsquo;s owl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached
London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was
the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell
off you &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was <i>you.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I feared I might be too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You nearly were, I couldn&rsquo;t have kept him off the
Stone much longer &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not the Stone, boy, you &mdash; the effort involved
nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it
had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Destroyed?&rdquo; said Harry blankly. &ldquo;But your
friend &mdash; Nicolas Flamel &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know about Nicolas?&rdquo; said Dumbledore,
sounding quite delighted. &ldquo;You <i>did</i> do the thing
properly, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little
chat, and agreed it&rsquo;s all for the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that means he and his wife will die, won&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in
order and then, yes, they will die.&rdquo;</p><p>Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry&rsquo;s
face.</p><p>&ldquo;To one as young as you, I&rsquo;m sure it seems
incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going
to bed after a very, <i>very</i> long day. After all, to the
well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You
know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much
money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings
would choose above all &mdash; the trouble is, humans do have a
knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for
them.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and
smiled at the ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sir &mdash; even if the Stone&rsquo;s
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for
things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing
itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort&rsquo;s going to try other ways
of coming back, isn&rsquo;t he? I mean, he hasn&rsquo;t gone, has
he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere,
perhaps looking for another body to share&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not
being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he
shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to
power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight
what seems a losing battle next time &mdash; and if he is delayed
again, and again, why, he may never return to power.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head
hurt. Then he said, &ldquo;Sir, there are some other things
I&rsquo;d like to know, if you can tell me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
things I want to know the truth
about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The truth.&rdquo; Dumbledore sighed. &ldquo;It is a
beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have
a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you&rsquo;ll forgive
me. I shall not, of course, lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Voldemort said that he only
killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But
why would he want to kill me in the first place?&rdquo;</p><p>Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not
today. Not now. You will know, one day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put it
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are
older&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know you hate to hear
this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when you are ready, you will
know.&rdquo;</p><p>And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.</p><p>&ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t Quirrell touch me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing
Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn&rsquo;t realize
that love as powerful as your mother&rsquo;s for you leaves its own
mark. Not a scar, no visible sign&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to have been
loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will
give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with
Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to
touch a person marked by something so good.&rdquo;</p><p>Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the
windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.
When he had found his voice again, Harry said, &ldquo;And the
Invisibility Cloak &mdash; do you know who sent it to
me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah &mdash; your father happened to leave it in my
possession, and I thought you might like it.&rdquo;
Dumbledore&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Useful
things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your father used it mainly for sneaking
off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s something
else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fire away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quirrell said Snape &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Professor</i> Snape, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, him &mdash; Quirrell said he hates me because he
hated my father. Is that true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape
could never forgive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He saved his life.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; said Dumbledore dreamily.
&ldquo;Funny, the way people&rsquo;s minds work, isn&rsquo;t it?
Professor Snape couldn&rsquo;t bear being in your father&rsquo;s
debt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do believe he worked so hard to
protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your
father even. Then he could go back to hating your father&rsquo;s
memory in peace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;And sir, there&rsquo;s one more
thing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just the one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, now, I&rsquo;m glad you asked me that. It was one of
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that&rsquo;s
saying something. You see, only one who wanted to <i>find</i> the
Stone &mdash; find it, but not use it &mdash; would be able to get
it, otherwise they&rsquo;d just see themselves making gold or
drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me
sometimes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, enough questions. I suggest
you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott&rsquo;s Every
Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a
vomit-flavored one, and since then I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
rather lost my liking for them &mdash; but I think I&rsquo;ll be
safe with a nice toffee, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then
he choked and said, &ldquo;Alas! Ear wax!&rdquo;</p><p class="break">Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but
very strict.</p><p>&ldquo;Just five minutes,&rdquo; Harry pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You let Professor Dumbledore
in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite
different. You need <i>rest.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on,
Madam Pomfrey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But five minutes
<i>only.&rdquo;</i></p><p>And she let Ron and Hermione in.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but
Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very
sore.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to &mdash;
Dumbledore was so worried &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The whole school&rsquo;s talking about it,&rdquo; said
Ron. &ldquo;What <i>really</i> happened?&rdquo;</p><p>It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even
more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them
everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and
Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right
places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell&rsquo;s
turban, Hermione screamed out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;So the Stone&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; said Ron finally.
&ldquo;Flamel&rsquo;s just going to <i>die</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that
&mdash; what was it? &mdash;&lsquo;to the well-organized mind,
death is but the next great adventure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I always said he was off his rocker,&rdquo; said Ron,
looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.</p><p>&ldquo;So what happened to you two?&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I got back all right,&rdquo; said Hermione.
&ldquo;I brought Ron round &mdash; that took a while &mdash; and we
were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him
in the entrance hall &mdash; he already knew &mdash; he just said,
&lsquo;Harry&rsquo;s gone after him, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; and
hurtled off to the third floor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think he meant you to do it?&rdquo; said Ron.
&ldquo;Sending you your father&rsquo;s Cloak and
everything?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;</i> Hermione exploded, &ldquo;if he did
&mdash; I mean to say &mdash; that&rsquo;s terrible &mdash; you
could have been killed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harry thoughtfully.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of
wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty
good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just
taught us enough to help. I don&rsquo;t think it was an accident he
let me find out how the mirror worked. It&rsquo;s almost like he
thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I
could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Dumbledore&rsquo;s off his rocker, all
right,&rdquo; said Ron proudly. &ldquo;Listen, you&rsquo;ve got to
be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and
Slytherin won, of course &mdash; you missed the last Quidditch
match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you &mdash; but
the food&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,&rdquo;
she said firmly.</p><p class="break">After a good night&rsquo;s sleep, Harry felt
nearly back to normal.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to go to the feast,&rdquo; he told Madam Pomfrey
as she straightened his many candy boxes. &ldquo;I can, can&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to
go,&rdquo; she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor
Dumbledore didn&rsquo;t realize how risky feasts could be.
&ldquo;And you have another visitor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was
indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to
Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &mdash; all &mdash; my &mdash; ruddy &mdash;
fault!&rdquo; he sobbed, his face in his hands. &ldquo;I told the
evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing
he didn&rsquo;t know, an&rsquo; I told him! Yeh could&rsquo;ve
died! All fer a dragon egg! I&rsquo;ll never drink again! I should
be chucked out an&rsquo; made ter live as a Muggle!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid!&rdquo; said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking
with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard.
&ldquo;Hagrid, he&rsquo;d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort
we&rsquo;re talking about, he&rsquo;d have found out even if you
hadn&rsquo;t told him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeh could&rsquo;ve died!&rdquo; sobbed Hagrid.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo; say the name!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;VOLDEMORT!&rdquo; Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so
shocked, he stopped crying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him and I&rsquo;m
calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the
Stone, it&rsquo;s gone, he can&rsquo;t use it. Have a Chocolate
Frog, I&rsquo;ve got loads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said,
&ldquo;That reminds me. I&rsquo;ve got yeh a present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a stoat sandwich, is it?&rdquo; said Harry
anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.
&rsquo;Course, he shoulda sacked me instead &mdash; anyway, got yeh
this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH17M02S">It seemed to be a handsome,
leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of
wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were
his mother and father.</p><p>&ldquo;Sent owls off ter all yer parents&rsquo; old school
friends, askin&rsquo; fer photos&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knew yeh
didn&rsquo; have any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. d&rsquo;yeh like
it?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t speak, but Hagrid understood.</p><p id="HP01CH17M02E"/><p id="HP01CH17M03S" class="break">Harry made his way down
to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by
Madam Pomfrey&rsquo;s fussing about, insisting on giving him one
last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out
in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate
Slytherin&rsquo;s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a
row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall
behind the High Table.</p><p>When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody
started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron
and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact
that people were standing up to look at him.</p><p>Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died
away.</p><p>&ldquo;Another year gone!&rdquo; Dumbledore said cheerfully.
&ldquo;And I must trouble you with an old man&rsquo;s wheezing
waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a
year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than
they were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have the whole summer ahead to
get them nice and empty before next year
starts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor,
with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with
three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and
twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.&rdquo;</p><p>A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin
table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the
table. It was a sickening sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,&rdquo; said Dumbledore.
&ldquo;However, recent events must be taken into
account.&rdquo;</p><p>The room went very still. The Slytherins&rsquo; smiles faded a
little.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; said Dumbledore. &ldquo;I have a few
last-minute points to dish out. Let me see.
Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&ldquo;First &mdash; to Mr. Ronald
Weasley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad
sunburn.</p><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the best-played game of chess
Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty
points.&rdquo;</p><p>Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other
prefects, &ldquo;My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got
past McGonagall&rsquo;s giant chess set!&rdquo;</p><p>At last there was silence again.</p><p>&ldquo;Second &mdash; to Miss Hermione
Granger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the use of cool logic in the face
of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected
she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were
beside themselves &mdash; they were a hundred points up.</p><p>&ldquo;Third &mdash; to Mr. Harry
Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for pure nerve and outstanding
courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.&rdquo;</p><p>The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling
themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and
seventy-two points &mdash; exactly the same as Slytherin. They had
tied for the House Cup &mdash; if only Dumbledore had given Harry
just one more point.</p><p>Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.</p><p>&ldquo;There are all kinds of courage,&rdquo; said Dumbledore,
smiling. &ldquo;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our
enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore
award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought
some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that
erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood
up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared
under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a
point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in
the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn&rsquo;t have looked more
stunned and horrified if he&rsquo;d just had the Body-Bind Curse
put on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; Dumbledore called over the storm of
applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the
downfall of Slytherin, &ldquo;we need a little change of
decoration.&rdquo;</p><p>He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became
scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent
vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was
shaking Professor McGonagall&rsquo;s hand, with a horrible, forced
smile. He caught Harry&rsquo;s eye and Harry knew at once that
Snape&rsquo;s feelings toward him hadn&rsquo;t changed one jot.
This didn&rsquo;t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be
back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at
Hogwarts.</p><p>It was the best evening of Harry&rsquo;s life, better than
winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain
trolls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he would never, ever forget
tonight.</p><p id="HP01CH17M03E" class="break">Harry had almost
forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they
did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good
marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for
his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost
as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed,
too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn&rsquo;t have
everything in life.</p><p>And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were
packed, Neville&rsquo;s toad was found lurking in a corner of the
toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to
use magic over the holidays (&ldquo;I always hope they&rsquo;ll
forget to give us these,&rdquo; said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid
was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed
across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking
and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating
Bertie Bott&rsquo;s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle
towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and
coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at
King&rsquo;s Cross station.</p><p>It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A
wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go
through the gate in twos and threes so they didn&rsquo;t attract
attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming
the Muggles.</p><p>&ldquo;You must come and stay this summer,&rdquo; said Ron,
&ldquo;both of you &mdash; I&rsquo;ll send you an owl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need
something to look forward to.&rdquo;</p><p>People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway
back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you, Potter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still famous,&rdquo; said Ron, grinning at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not where I&rsquo;m going, I promise you,&rdquo; said
Harry.</p><p>He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.</p><p>&ldquo;There he is, Mum, there he is, look!&rdquo;</p><p>It was Ginny Weasley, Ron&rsquo;s younger sister, but she
wasn&rsquo;t pointing at Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Potter!&rdquo; she squealed. &ldquo;Look, Mum! I
can see &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Ginny, and it&rsquo;s rude to point.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</p><p>&ldquo;Busy year?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Thanks for the fudge and
the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it was nothing, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still
looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in
a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia
and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;You must be Harry&rsquo;s family!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Weasley.</p><p>&ldquo;In a manner of speaking,&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon.
&ldquo;Hurry up, boy, we haven&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo; He
walked away.</p><p>Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;See you over the summer, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hope you have &mdash; er &mdash; a good holiday,&rdquo;
said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that
anyone could be so unpleasant.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I will,&rdquo; said Harry, and they were surprised at
the grin that was spreading over his face. &ldquo;<i>They</i>
don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re not allowed to use magic at home.
I&rsquo;m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this
summer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
