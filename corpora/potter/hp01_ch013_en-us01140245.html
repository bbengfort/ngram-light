Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the
rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded
at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what
he&rsquo;d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He
started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his
parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice
cackled with laughter.</p> <p>&ldquo;You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive
you mad,&rdquo; said Ron, when Harry told him about these
dreams.</p>    <p>Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a
different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea
of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row
(&ldquo;If Filch had caught you!&rdquo;), and disappointment that
he hadn&rsquo;t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.</p>   <p>They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a
library book, even though Harry was still sure he&rsquo;d read the
name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming
through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even
less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had
started again.</p>    <p>Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless
rain that had replaced the snow couldn&rsquo;t dampen his spirits.
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry
was on Wood&rsquo;s side. If they won their next match, against
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship
for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,
Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out
after training.</p>     <p>Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session,
Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He&rsquo;d just gotten very
angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and
pretending to fall off their brooms.</p>    <p>&ldquo;Will you stop messing around!&rdquo; he yelled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the sort of thing that&rsquo;ll lose us
the match! Snape&rsquo;s refereeing this time, and he&rsquo;ll be
looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!&rdquo;</p>      <p>George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Snape&rsquo;s</i> refereeing?&rdquo; he spluttered
through a mouthful of mud. &ldquo;When&rsquo;s he ever refereed a
Quidditch match? He&rsquo;s not going to be fair if we might
overtake Slytherin.&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> fault,&rdquo; said Wood.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so
Snape hasn&rsquo;t got an excuse to pick on us.&rdquo;</p><p>Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another
reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing
Quidditch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual
at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the
Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing
chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something
Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me for a moment,&rdquo; said Ron when
Harry sat down next to him, &ldquo;I need to concen &mdash;&rdquo;
He caught sight of Harry&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with you? You look terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the
other two about Snape&rsquo;s sudden, sinister desire to be a
Quidditch referee.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; said Hermione at once.</p><p>&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re ill,&rdquo; said Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretend to break your leg,&rdquo; Hermione suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Really</i> break your leg,&rdquo; said Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can&rsquo;t
play at all.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had
managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone&rsquo;s
guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they
recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and
performed the countercurse. Neville&rsquo;s legs sprang apart and
he got to his feet, trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Hermione asked him, leading him
over to sit with Harry and Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Malfoy,&rdquo; said Neville shakily. &ldquo;I met him
outside the library. He said he&rsquo;d been looking for someone to
practice that on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to Professor McGonagall!&rdquo; Hermione urged
Neville. &ldquo;Report him!&rdquo;</p><p>Neville shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want more trouble,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to stand up to him, Neville!&rdquo; said
Ron. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s used to walking all over people, but
that&rsquo;s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it
easier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to tell me I&rsquo;m not brave
enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy&rsquo;s already done
that,&rdquo; Neville choked out.</p><p>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate
Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for
Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might
cry.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worth twelve of Malfoy,&rdquo; Harry said.
&ldquo;The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn&rsquo;t it?
And where&rsquo;s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.&rdquo;</p><p>Neville&rsquo;s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped
the frog.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I&rsquo;ll go
to bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D&rsquo;you want the card, you collect
them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH13M01S">As Neville walked away, Harry looked
at the Famous Wizard card.</p><p>&ldquo;Dumbledore again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;He was the first
one I ever &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up
at Ron and Hermione.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found him!&rdquo;</i> he whispered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found Flamel! I <i>told</i> you I&rsquo;d read
the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here
&mdash; listen to this: &lsquo;Dumbledore is particularly famous
for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&rsquo;s blood, <i>and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn&rsquo;t looked so excited
since they&rsquo;d gotten back the marks for their very first piece
of homework.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay there!&rdquo; she said, and she sprinted up the
stairs to the girls&rsquo; dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had
time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an
enormous old book in her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought to look in here!&rdquo; she whispered
excitedly. &ldquo;I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit
of light reading.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Light?&rdquo;</i> said Ron, but Hermione told him to
be quiet until she&rsquo;d looked something up, and started
flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.</p><p>At last she found what she was looking for.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it! I <i>knew</i> it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are we allowed to speak yet?&rdquo; said Ron grumpily.
Hermione ignored him.</p><p>&ldquo;Nicolas Flamel,&rdquo; she whispered dramatically,
&ldquo;is the <i>only known maker of the Sorcerer&rsquo;s
Stone</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>This didn&rsquo;t have quite the effect she&rsquo;d
expected.</p><p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; said Harry and Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>honestly,</i> don&rsquo;t you two read? Look
&mdash; read that, there.&rdquo;</p><p>She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with
making the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone, a legendary substance with
astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure
gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the
drinker immortal.</i></p><p><i>There have been many reports of the
Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone
currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in
Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).</i></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Hermione, when Harry
and Ron had finished. &ldquo;The dog must be guarding
Flamel&rsquo;s Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to
keep it safe for him, because they&rsquo;re friends and he knew
someone was after it, that&rsquo;s why he wanted the Stone moved
out of Gringotts!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever
dying!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;No wonder Snape&rsquo;s after it!
<i>Anyone</i> would want it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And no wonder we couldn&rsquo;t find Flamel in that
<i>Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,</i>&rdquo; said Ron.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not exactly recent if he&rsquo;s six hundred and
sixty-five, is he?&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH13M01E" class="break">The next morning in
Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of
treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what
they&rsquo;d do with a Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone if they had one. It
wasn&rsquo;t until Ron said he&rsquo;d buy his own Quidditch team
that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to play,&rdquo; he told Ron and Hermione.
&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t, all the Slytherins will think I&rsquo;m
just too scared to face Snape. I&rsquo;ll show
them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;ll really wipe the smiles off
their faces if we win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just as long as we&rsquo;re not wiping you off the
field,&rdquo; said Hermione.</p><p class="break">As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became
more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest
of the team wasn&rsquo;t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking
Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done
it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a
biased referee?</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t know whether he was imagining it or not, but
he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he
even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him
on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know
they&rsquo;d found out about the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone? Harry
didn&rsquo;t see how he could &mdash; yet he sometimes had the
horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.</p><p class="break">Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside
the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were
wondering whether they&rsquo;d ever see him alive again. This
wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a
word of Wood&rsquo;s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes
and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.</p><p>Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands
next to Neville, who couldn&rsquo;t understand why they looked so
grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the
match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been
secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They&rsquo;d gotten the
idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on
Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s <i>Locomotor
Mortis,</i>&rdquo; Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his
sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>know,</i>&rdquo; Ron snapped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
nag.&rdquo;</p><p>Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever
need an early capture of the Snitch it&rsquo;s now. Finish the game
before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The whole school&rsquo;s out there!&rdquo; said Fred
Weasley, peering out of the door. &ldquo;Even &mdash; blimey
&mdash; Dumbledore&rsquo;s come to watch!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart did a somersault.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Dumbledore?&rdquo;</i> he said, dashing to the door to
make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver
beard.</p><p>Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe.
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if
Dumbledore was watching.</p><p>Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams
marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Snape look so mean,&rdquo; he told
Hermione. &ldquo;Look &mdash; they&rsquo;re off. Ouch!&rdquo;</p><p>Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was
Malfoy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn&rsquo;t see you
there.&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder how long Potter&rsquo;s going to stay on his broom
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron didn&rsquo;t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a
penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione,
who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly
at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the
Snitch.</p><p>&ldquo;You know how I think they choose people for the
Gryffindor team?&rdquo; said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as
Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s people they feel sorry for. See, there&rsquo;s
Potter, who&rsquo;s got no parents, then there&rsquo;s the
Weasleys, who&rsquo;ve got no money &mdash; you should be on the
team, Longbottom, you&rsquo;ve got no brains.&rdquo;</p><p>Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face
Malfoy.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,&rdquo; he
stammered.</p><p>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still
not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, &ldquo;You tell
him, Neville.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Longbottom, if brains were gold you&rsquo;d be poorer
than Weasley, and that&rsquo;s saying something.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point
with anxiety about Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you, Malfoy &mdash; one more word
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ron!&rdquo; said Hermione suddenly, &ldquo;Harry &mdash;
!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew
gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed
fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a
bullet.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, Weasley, Potter&rsquo;s obviously
spotted some money on the ground!&rdquo; said Malfoy.</p><p>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on
top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then
clambered over the back of his seat to help.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Harry!&rdquo; Hermione screamed, leaping onto
her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape &mdash; she
didn&rsquo;t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her
seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that
was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.</p><p>Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to
see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches &mdash;
the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised
in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.</p><p>The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever
remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game&rsquo;s over!
Harry&rsquo;s won! We&rsquo;ve won! Gryffindor is in the
lead!&rdquo; shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and
hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.</p><p>Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He
couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He&rsquo;d done it &mdash; the game was
over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came
spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and
tight-lipped &mdash; then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and
looked up into Dumbledore&rsquo;s smiling face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; said Dumbledore quietly, so that only
Harry could hear. &ldquo;Nice to see you haven&rsquo;t been
brooding about that mirror&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. been keeping
busy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excellent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Snape spat bitterly on the ground.</p><p class="break">Harry left the locker room alone some time later,
to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He
couldn&rsquo;t ever remember feeling happier. He&rsquo;d really
done something to be proud of now &mdash; no one could say he was
just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so
sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his
head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto
their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.</p><p>Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door
and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the
setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He&rsquo;d done it, he&rsquo;d
shown Snape.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p id="HP01CH13M02S">And speaking of
Snape&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible
toward the forbidden forest. Harry&rsquo;s victory faded from his
mind as he watched. He recognized the figure&rsquo;s prowling walk.
Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner
&mdash; what was going on?</p><p id="HP01CH13M02E">Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two
Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw
Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.</p><p>The trees were so thick he couldn&rsquo;t see where Snape had
gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top
branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and
landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.</p><p>He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to
his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.</p><p>Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn&rsquo;t
alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn&rsquo;t make out the
look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry
strained to catch what they were saying.</p><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. d-don&rsquo;t know why you wanted t-t-to
meet here of all p-places, Severus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought we&rsquo;d keep this private,&rdquo; said
Snape, his voice icy. &ldquo;Students aren&rsquo;t supposed to know
about the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone, after all.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape
interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you found out how to get past that beast of
Hagrid&rsquo;s yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;B-b-but Severus, I &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,&rdquo;
said Snape, taking a step toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know what you &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know perfectly well what I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He
steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, &ldquo;&mdash; your
little bit of hocus-pocus. I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;B-but I d-d-don&rsquo;t &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Snape cut in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
another little chat soon, when you&rsquo;ve had time to think
things over and decided where your loyalties lie.&rdquo;</p><p>He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing
quite still as though he was petrified.</p><p class="break">&ldquo;Harry, where have you <i>been</i>?&rdquo;
Hermione squeaked.</p><p>&ldquo;We won! You won! We won!&rdquo; shouted Ron, thumping
Harry on the back. &ldquo;And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and
Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He&rsquo;s
still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he&rsquo;ll be all right
&mdash; talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone&rsquo;s waiting for
you in the common room, we&rsquo;re having a party, Fred and George
stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind that now,&rdquo; said Harry breathlessly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find an empty room, you wait &rsquo;til you hear
this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>He made sure Peeves wasn&rsquo;t inside before shutting the door
behind them, then he told them what he&rsquo;d seen and heard.</p><p>&ldquo;So we were right, it <i>is</i> the Sorcerer&rsquo;s
Stone, and Snape&rsquo;s trying to force Quirrell to help him get
it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy &mdash; and he said
something about Quirrell&rsquo;s &lsquo;hocus-pocus&rsquo;&mdash; I
reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy,
loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some
anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you mean the Stone&rsquo;s only safe as long as
Quirrell stands up to Snape?&rdquo; said Hermione in alarm.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be gone by next Tuesday,&rdquo; said Ron.</p></body></html>
