he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before
he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions
with the Slytherins, so they didn&rsquo;t have to put up with
Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn&rsquo;t until they spotted a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all
groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday &mdash; and
Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.</p> <p>&ldquo;Typical,&rdquo; said Harry darkly. &ldquo;Just what I
always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of
Malfoy.&rdquo;</p>    <p>He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than
anything else.</p>   <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ll make a fool of
yourself,&rdquo; said Ron reasonably. &ldquo;Anyway, I know
Malfoy&rsquo;s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch,
but I bet that&rsquo;s all talk.&rdquo;</p>    <p>Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained
loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams
and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him
narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn&rsquo;t the only
one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he&rsquo;d spent most
of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.
Even Ron would tell anyone who&rsquo;d listen about the time
he&rsquo;d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie&rsquo;s old broom.
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared
their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn&rsquo;t see what was
exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed
to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean&rsquo;s poster of West
Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.</p>     <p>Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt
she&rsquo;d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an
extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the
ground.</p>    <p>Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville
was. This was something you couldn&rsquo;t learn by heart out of a
book &mdash; not that she hadn&rsquo;t tried. At breakfast on
Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she&rsquo;d
gotten out of a library book called <i>Quidditch Through the
Ages.</i> Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for
anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but
everybody else was very pleased when Hermione&rsquo;s lecture was
interrupted by the arrival of the mail.</p>      <p>Harry hadn&rsquo;t had a single letter since Hagrid&rsquo;s
note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
Malfoy&rsquo;s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets
from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.</p><p>A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.
He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a
large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Remembrall!&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Gran
knows I forget things &mdash; this tells you if there&rsquo;s
something you&rsquo;ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight
like this and if it turns red &mdash;
oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
you&rsquo;ve forgotten something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Neville was trying to remember what he&rsquo;d forgotten when
Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the
Remembrall out of his hand.</p><p>Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a
reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot
trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a
flash.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Malfoy&rsquo;s got my Remembrall, Professor.&rdquo;</p><p>Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the
table.</p><p>&ldquo;Just looking,&rdquo; he said, and he sloped away with
Crabbe and Goyle behind him.</p><p class="break">At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and
the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds
for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the
grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping
lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the
grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in
the distance.</p><p>The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred
and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that
some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always
flew slightly to the left.</p><p>Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair,
and yellow eyes like a hawk.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what are you all waiting for?&rdquo; she barked.
&ldquo;Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry
up.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the
twigs stuck out at odd angles.</p><p>&ldquo;Stick out your right hand over your broom,&rdquo; called
Madam Hooch at the front, &ldquo;and say
&lsquo;Up!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;UP!&rdquo; everyone shouted.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one
of the few that did. Hermione Granger&rsquo;s had simply rolled
over on the ground, and Neville&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t moved at all.
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid,
thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville&rsquo;s voice that
said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the
ground.</p><p>Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without
sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting
their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy
he&rsquo;d been doing it wrong for years.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the
ground, hard,&rdquo; said Madam Hooch. &ldquo;Keep your brooms
steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by
leaning forward slightly. On my whistle &mdash; three &mdash; two
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on
the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam
Hooch&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Come back, boy!&rdquo; she shouted, but Neville was
rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle &mdash; twelve
feet &mdash; twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down
at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the
broom and &mdash;</p><p>WHAM &mdash; a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown
on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and
higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and
out of sight.</p><p>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as
his.</p><p>&ldquo;Broken wrist,&rdquo; Harry heard her mutter. &ldquo;Come
on, boy &mdash; it&rsquo;s all right, up you get.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to the rest of the class.</p><p>&ldquo;None of you is to move while I take this boy to the
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or
you&rsquo;ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say
&lsquo;Quidditch.&rsquo; Come on, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled
off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.</p><p>No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into
laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see his face, the great lump?&rdquo;</p><p>The other Slytherins joined in.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Malfoy,&rdquo; snapped Parvati Patil.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?&rdquo; said Pansy
Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. &ldquo;Never thought
<i>you&rsquo;d</i> like fat little crybabies, Parvati.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching
something out of the grass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that stupid thing
Longbottom&rsquo;s gran sent him.&rdquo;</p><p>The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Give that here, Malfoy,&rdquo; said Harry quietly.
Everyone stopped talking to watch.</p><p>Malfoy smiled nastily.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to
find &mdash; how about &mdash; up a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it <i>here</i>!&rdquo; Harry yelled, but Malfoy had
leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn&rsquo;t been
lying, he <i>could</i> fly well. Hovering level with the topmost
branches of an oak he called, &ldquo;Come and get it,
Potter!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry grabbed his broom.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</i> shouted Hermione Granger. &ldquo;Madam
Hooch told us not to move &mdash; you&rsquo;ll get us all into
trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted
the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared;
air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him
&mdash; and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he&rsquo;d found
something he could do without being taught &mdash; this was easy,
this was <i>wonderful.</i> He pulled his broomstick up a little to
take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on
the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.</p><p>He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
Malfoy looked stunned.</p><p>&ldquo;Give it here,&rdquo; Harry called, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll
knock you off that broom!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but
looking worried.</p><p>Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped
the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a
javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a
sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were
clapping.</p><p>&ldquo;No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,
Malfoy,&rdquo; Harry called.</p><p>The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.</p><p id="HP01CH09M01S">&ldquo;Catch it if you can,
then!&rdquo; he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the
air and streaked back toward the ground.</p><p>Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air
and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom
handle down &mdash; next second he was gathering speed in a steep
dive, racing the ball &mdash; wind whistled in his ears, mingled
with the screams of people watching &mdash; he stretched out his
hand &mdash; a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to
pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with
the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.</p><p id="HP01CH09M01E">&ldquo;HARRY POTTER!&rdquo;</p><p>His heart sank faster than he&rsquo;d just dived. Professor
McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet,
trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i> &mdash; in all my time at Hogwarts
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her
glasses flashed furiously, &ldquo;&mdash; how <i>dare</i> you
&mdash; might have broken your neck &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his fault, Professor &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Miss Patil &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But Malfoy &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>enough,</i> Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow
me, now.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&rsquo;s
triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor
McGonagall&rsquo;s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was
going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something
to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his
voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking
at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he&rsquo;d done it. He
hadn&rsquo;t even lasted two weeks. He&rsquo;d be packing his bags
in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on
the doorstep?</p><p>Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still
Professor McGonagall didn&rsquo;t say a word to him. She wrenched
open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting
miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He
thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
Perhaps he could be Hagrid&rsquo;s assistant. His stomach twisted
as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards
while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid&rsquo;s
bag.</p><p>Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the
door and poked her head inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a
moment?&rdquo;</p><p>Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going
to use on him?</p><p>But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who
came out of Flitwick&rsquo;s class looking confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me, you two,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall, and
they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;In here.&rdquo;</p><p>Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was
empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the
blackboard.</p><p>&ldquo;Out, Peeves!&rdquo; she barked. Peeves threw the chalk
into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face
the two boys.</p><p>&ldquo;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood &mdash; I&rsquo;ve
found you a Seeker.&rdquo;</p><p>Wood&rsquo;s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious, Professor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall crisply.
&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s a natural. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything
like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,
Potter?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded silently. He didn&rsquo;t have a clue what was
going on, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be being expelled, and some
of the feeling started coming back to his legs.</p><p>&ldquo;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot
dive,&rdquo; Professor McGonagall told Wood. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn&rsquo;t have done
it.&rdquo;</p><p>Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at
once.</p><p>&ldquo;Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?&rdquo; he asked
excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Wood&rsquo;s captain of the Gryffindor team,&rdquo;
Professor McGonagall explained.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just the build for a Seeker, too,&rdquo; said
Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. &ldquo;Light
&mdash; speedy &mdash; we&rsquo;ll have to get him a decent broom,
Professor &mdash; a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,
I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we
can&rsquo;t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a
better team than last year. <i>Flattened</i> in that last match by
Slytherin, I couldn&rsquo;t look Severus Snape in the face for
weeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to hear you&rsquo;re training hard, Potter, or I
may change my mind about punishing you.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she suddenly smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Your father would have been proud,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.&rdquo;</p><p class="break">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>joking.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had
happened when he&rsquo;d left the grounds with Professor
McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his
mouth, but he&rsquo;d forgotten all about it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Seeker?&rdquo;</i> he said. &ldquo;But first years
<i>never</i> &mdash; you must be the youngest House player in about
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; a century,&rdquo; said Harry, shoveling pie into
his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon. &ldquo;Wood told me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I start training next week,&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a
secret.&rdquo;</p><p>Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry,
and hurried over.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; said George in a low voice. &ldquo;Wood
told us. We&rsquo;re on the team too &mdash; Beaters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you, we&rsquo;re going to win that Quidditch Cup
for sure this year,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t won
since Charlie left, but this year&rsquo;s team is going to be
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when
he told us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons
he&rsquo;s found a new secret passageway out of the
school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bet it&rsquo;s that one behind the statue of Gregory the
Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.&rdquo;</p><p>Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less
welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.</p><p>&ldquo;Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the
train back to the Muggles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot braver now that you&rsquo;re back on
the ground and you&rsquo;ve got your little friends with
you,&rdquo; said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all
little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of
teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles
and scowl.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you on anytime on my own,&rdquo; said
Malfoy. &ldquo;Tonight, if you want. Wizard&rsquo;s duel. Wands
only &mdash; no contact. What&rsquo;s the matter? Never heard of a
wizard&rsquo;s duel before, I suppose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course he has,&rdquo; said Ron, wheeling around.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his second, who&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p><p>Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.</p><p>&ldquo;Crabbe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Midnight all right?
We&rsquo;ll meet you in the trophy room; that&rsquo;s always
unlocked.&rdquo;</p><p>When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> a wizard&rsquo;s duel?&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;And what do you mean, you&rsquo;re my second?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, a second&rsquo;s there to take over if you
die,&rdquo; said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold
pie. Catching the look on Harry&rsquo;s face, he added quickly,
&ldquo;But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real
wizards. The most you and Malfoy&rsquo;ll be able to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any
real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what if I wave my wand and nothing
happens?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Throw it away and punch him on the nose,&rdquo; Ron
suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</p><p>They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a person eat in peace in this place?&rdquo;
said Ron.</p><p>Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing what you and Malfoy
were saying &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bet you could,&rdquo; Ron muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; and you <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> go wandering around
the school at night, think of the points you&rsquo;ll lose
Gryffindor if you&rsquo;re caught, and you&rsquo;re bound to be.
It&rsquo;s really very selfish of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s really none of your business,&rdquo; said
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Ron.</p><p class="break">All the same, it wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d
call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake
much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville
wasn&rsquo;t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all
evening giving him advice such as &ldquo;If he tries to curse you,
you&rsquo;d better dodge it, because I can&rsquo;t remember how to
block them.&rdquo; There was a very good chance they were going to
get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing
his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand,
Malfoy&rsquo;s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness
&mdash; this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He
couldn&rsquo;t miss it.</p><p>&ldquo;Half-past eleven,&rdquo; Ron muttered at last,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;</p><p>They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept
across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the
Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the
fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from
the chair nearest them, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re
going to do this, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink
bathrobe and a frown.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</i> said Ron furiously. &ldquo;Go back to
bed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I almost told your brother,&rdquo; Hermione snapped,
&ldquo;Percy &mdash; he&rsquo;s a prefect, he&rsquo;d put a stop to
this.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t believe anyone could be so interfering.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said to Ron. He pushed open the
portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.</p><p>Hermione wasn&rsquo;t going to give up that easily. She followed
Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry
goose.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>care</i> about Gryffindor, do you
<i>only</i> care about yourselves, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want
Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you&rsquo;ll lose all the
points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I
said when you&rsquo;re on the train home tomorrow, you&rsquo;re so
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But what they were, they didn&rsquo;t find out. Hermione had
turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found
herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a
nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor
Tower.</p><p>&ldquo;Now what am I going to do?&rdquo; she asked shrilly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your problem,&rdquo; said Ron.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go, we&rsquo;re going to be
late.&rdquo;</p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t even reached the end of the corridor when
Hermione caught up with them.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming with you,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;You are <i>not.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;m going to stand out here and
wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I&rsquo;ll
tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back
me up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some nerve &mdash;&rdquo; said Ron
loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, both of you!&rdquo; said Harry sharply. &ldquo;I
heard something.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a sort of snuffling.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Norris?&rdquo; breathed Ron, squinting through the
dark.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on
the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept
nearer.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you found me! I&rsquo;ve been out here for
hours, I couldn&rsquo;t remember the new password to get in to
bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down, Neville. The password&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Pig snout&rsquo; but it won&rsquo;t help you now, the Fat
Lady&rsquo;s gone off somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your arm?&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Neville, showing them. &ldquo;Madam
Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good &mdash; well, look, Neville, we&rsquo;ve got to be
somewhere, we&rsquo;ll see you later &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; said Neville, scrambling to
his feet, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay here alone, the Bloody
Baron&rsquo;s been past twice already.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione
and Neville.</p><p>&ldquo;If either of you get us caught, I&rsquo;ll never rest
until I&rsquo;ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us
about, and used it on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to
use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet
and beckoned them all forward.</p><p>They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from
the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or
Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the
third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.</p><p id="HP01CH09M02S">Malfoy and Crabbe weren&rsquo;t there
yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught
them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in
the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the
doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case
Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s late, maybe he&rsquo;s chickened out,&rdquo;
Ron whispered.</p><p>Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only
just raised his wand when they heard someone speak &mdash; and it
wasn&rsquo;t Malfoy.</p><p>&ldquo;Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a
corner.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved
madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they
scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch&rsquo;s voice.
Neville&rsquo;s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they
heard Filch enter the trophy room.</p><p id="HP01CH09M02E">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in here
somewhere,&rdquo; they heard him mutter, &ldquo;probably
hiding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; Harry mouthed to the others and,
petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of
armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let
out a frightened squeak and broke into a run &mdash; he tripped,
grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right
into a suit of armor.</p><p>The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole
castle.</p><p>&ldquo;RUN!&rdquo; Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted
down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was
following &mdash; they swung around the doorpost and galloped down
one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea
where they were or where they were going &mdash; they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway,
hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which
they knew was miles from the trophy room.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve lost him,&rdquo; Harry panted,
leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was
bent double, wheezing and spluttering.</p><p>&ldquo;I &mdash; <i>told</i> &mdash; you,&rdquo; Hermione
gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, &ldquo;I &mdash; told
&mdash; you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,&rdquo;
said Ron, &ldquo;quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Malfoy tricked you,&rdquo; Hermione said to Harry.
&ldquo;You realize that, don&rsquo;t you? He was never going to
meet you &mdash; Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy
room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn&rsquo;t going
to tell her that.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t going to be that simple. They hadn&rsquo;t gone
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came
shooting out of a classroom in front of them.</p><p>It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of
delight.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Peeves &mdash; please &mdash; you&rsquo;ll get
us thrown out.&rdquo;</p><p>Peeves cackled.</p><p>&ldquo;Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut,
tut. Naughty, naughty, you&rsquo;ll get caughty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if you don&rsquo;t give us away, Peeves,
please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should tell Filch, I should,&rdquo; said Peeves in a
saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
for your own good, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of the way,&rdquo; snapped Ron, taking a swipe at
Peeves &mdash; this was a big mistake.</p><p>&ldquo;STUDENTS OUT OF BED!&rdquo; Peeves bellowed,
&ldquo;STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH09M03S">Ducking under Peeves, they ran for
their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed
into a door &mdash; and it was locked.</p><p>&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly
at the door, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for! This is the
end!&rdquo;</p><p>They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could
toward Peeves&rsquo;s shouts.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, move over,&rdquo; Hermione snarled. She grabbed
Harry&rsquo;s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,
<i>&ldquo;Alohomora!&rdquo;</i></p><p>The lock clicked and the door swung open &mdash; they piled
through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it,
listening.</p><p>&ldquo;Which way did they go, Peeves?&rdquo; Filch was saying.
&ldquo;Quick, tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;please.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess with me, Peeves, now <i>where did they
go</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t say nothing if you don&rsquo;t say
please,&rdquo; said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.</p><p>&ldquo;All right &mdash; <i>please.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing
if you didn&rsquo;t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!&rdquo; And they
heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in
rage.</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks this door is locked,&rdquo; Harry whispered.
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be okay &mdash; get <i>off,</i>
Neville!&rdquo; For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry&rsquo;s bathrobe for the last minute.
<i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry turned around &mdash; and saw, quite clearly, what. For a
moment, he was sure he&rsquo;d walked into a nightmare &mdash; this
was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a
corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they
knew why it was forbidden.</p><p>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a
dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had
three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses,
twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths,
saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.</p><p>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and
Harry knew that the only reason they weren&rsquo;t already dead was
that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was
quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those
thunderous growls meant.</p><p id="HP01CH09M03E">Harry groped for the doorknob &mdash;
between Filch and death, he&rsquo;d take Filch.</p><p>They fell backward &mdash; Harry slammed the door shut, and they
ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have
hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they
didn&rsquo;t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared &mdash; all
they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them
and that monster. They didn&rsquo;t stop running until they reached
the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Where on earth have you all been?&rdquo; she asked,
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their
flushed, sweaty faces.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind that &mdash; pig snout, pig snout,&rdquo;
panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into
the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.</p><p>It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville,
indeed, looked as if he&rsquo;d never speak again.</p><p>&ldquo;What do they think they&rsquo;re doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?&rdquo; said Ron finally. &ldquo;If
any dog needs exercise, that one does.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back
again.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t use your eyes, any of you, do you?&rdquo;
she snapped. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see what it was standing
on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The floor?&rdquo; Harry suggested. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, <i>not</i> the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor.
It&rsquo;s obviously guarding something.&rdquo;</p><p>She stood up, glaring at them.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re pleased with yourselves. We could all
have been killed &mdash; or worse, expelled. Now, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron stared after her, his mouth open.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think we dragged her along, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p><p>But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he
climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding
something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was
the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide
&mdash; except perhaps Hogwarts.</p><p>It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little
package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</p></body></html>
