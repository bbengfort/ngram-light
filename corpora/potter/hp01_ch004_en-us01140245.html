They knocked
again. Dudley jerked awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cannon?&rdquo; he said stupidly.</p><p>There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding
into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands &mdash; now they
knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with
them.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I warn you
&mdash; I&rsquo;m armed!&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause. Then &mdash;</p><p>SMASH!</p><p>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its
hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</p><p id="HP01CH04M01S">A giant of a man was standing in the
doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy
mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his
eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.</p><p id="HP01CH04M01E">The giant squeezed his way into the
hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent
down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.
The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look
at them all.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t make us a cup o&rsquo; tea, could yeh?
It&rsquo;s not been an easy
journey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with
fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Budge up, yeh great lump,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p><p>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was
crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</p><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s Harry!&rdquo; said the giant.</p><p>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that
the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Las&rsquo; time I saw you, you was only a baby,&rdquo;
said the giant. &ldquo;Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but
yeh&rsquo;ve got yer mum&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</p><p>&ldquo;I demand that you leave at once, sir!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You are breaking and entering!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,&rdquo; said the
giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of
Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it
had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the
room.</p><p>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being
trodden on.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway &mdash; Harry,&rdquo; said the giant, turning his
back on the Dursleys, &ldquo;a very happy birthday to yeh. Got
summat fer yeh here &mdash; I mighta sat on it at some point, but
it&rsquo;ll taste all right.&rdquo;</p><p>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolate cake with <i>Happy Birthday Harry</i>
written on it in green icing.</p><p>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the
words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead
was, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>The giant chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;True, I haven&rsquo;t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry&rsquo;s whole
arm.</p><p>&ldquo;What about that tea then, eh?&rdquo; he said, rubbing his
hands together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not say no ter summat stronger if
yeh&rsquo;ve got it, mind.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in
it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they
couldn&rsquo;t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second
later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut
with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as
though he&rsquo;d sunk into a hot bath.</p><p id="HP01CH04M02S">The giant sat back down on the sofa,
which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things
out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package
of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle
of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to
make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling
sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he
slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the
poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.&rdquo;</p><p>The giant chuckled darkly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yer great puddin&rsquo; of a son don&rsquo; need
fattenin&rsquo; anymore, Dursley, don&rsquo; worry.&rdquo;</p><p>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never
tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn&rsquo;t take his
eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain
anything, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I still don&rsquo;t
really know who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back
of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Call me Hagrid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone does.
An&rsquo; like I told yeh, I&rsquo;m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts
&mdash; yeh&rsquo;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&rsquo;
course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er &mdash; no,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>Hagrid looked shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Harry said quickly.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</i> barked Hagrid, turning to stare at
the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; yer
letters but I never thought yeh wouldn&rsquo;t even know
abou&rsquo; Hogwarts, fer cryin&rsquo; out loud! Did yeh never
wonder where yer parents learned it all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All what?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;ALL WHAT?&rdquo; Hagrid thundered. &ldquo;Now wait
jus&rsquo; one second!&rdquo;</p><p>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the
whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean ter tell me,&rdquo; he growled at the
Dursleys, &ldquo;that this boy &mdash; this boy! &mdash; knows
nothin&rsquo; abou&rsquo;&mdash; about ANYTHING?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school,
after all, and his marks weren&rsquo;t bad.</p><p>&ldquo;I know <i>some</i> things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can,
you know, do math and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, &ldquo;About
<i>our</i> world, I mean. <i>Your</i> world. <i>My</i> world.
<i>Yer parents&rsquo; world.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What world?&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.</p><p>&ldquo;DURSLEY!&rdquo; he boomed.</p><p>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that
sounded like &ldquo;Mimblewimble.&rdquo; Hagrid stared wildly at
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I mean, they&rsquo;re <i>famous.</i> You&rsquo;re
<i>famous.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? My &mdash; my mum and dad weren&rsquo;t famous,
were they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeh don&rsquo; know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeh don&rsquo;
know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeh don&rsquo; know what yeh <i>are</i>?&rdquo; he said
finally.</p><p>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Stop right there, sir!
I forbid you to tell the boy anything!&rdquo;</p><p>A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the
furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every
syllable trembled with rage.</p><p>&ldquo;You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter
Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it,
Dursley! An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve kept it from him all these
years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kept <i>what</i> from me?&rdquo; said Harry eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;STOP! I FORBID YOU!&rdquo; yelled Uncle Vernon in
panic.</p><p>Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,&rdquo; said Hagrid.
&ldquo;Harry &mdash; yer a wizard.&rdquo;</p><p>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling
wind could be heard.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a what?&rdquo; gasped Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;A wizard, o&rsquo; course,&rdquo; said Hagrid, sitting
back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; a thumpin&rsquo; good&rsquo;un, I&rsquo;d say,
once yeh&rsquo;ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an&rsquo; dad
like yours, what else would yeh be? An&rsquo; I reckon it&rsquo;s
abou&rsquo; time yeh read yer letter.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish
envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor,
Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:</p><div class="top"><p class="center">HOGWARTS SCHOOL</p><p class="center"><i>of</i> WITCHCRAFT <i>and</i> WIZARDRY</p><p class="center"><img src="images/swash.jpg" width="150" height="22" alt="swash"/></p><p class="center">Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore</p><p class="center"><i>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc.,

accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find
enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</p><p>Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by
no later than July 31.</p><p class="noindent">Yours sincerely,</p><p class="noindent"><img src="images/minerva_sig.jpg" width="230" height="70" alt="Minerva McGonagall Signature"/></p><p class="noindent">Minerva McGonagall,</p><p class="noindent"><i>Deputy Headmistress</i></p></div></div><p class="noindent">Questions exploded inside Harry&rsquo;s head
like fireworks and he couldn&rsquo;t decide which to ask first.
After a few minutes he stammered, &ldquo;What does it mean, they
await my owl?&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH04M02E">&ldquo;Gallopin&rsquo; Gorgons, that
reminds me,&rdquo; said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead
with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl &mdash; a real, live,
rather ruffled-looking owl &mdash; a long quill, and a roll of
parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note
that Harry could read upside down:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div><div class="topbot"><p><i>Dear Professor Dumbledore,</i></p><p><i>Given Harry his letter.</i></p><p><i>Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.</i></p><p><i>Weather&rsquo;s horrible. Hope you&rsquo;re well.</i></p><p><i>Hagrid</i></p></div></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl,
which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl
out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this
was as normal as talking on the telephone.</p><p>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Where was I?&rdquo; said Hagrid, but at that moment,
Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into
the firelight.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Hagrid grunted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop
him,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; said Harry, interested.</p><p>&ldquo;A Muggle,&rdquo; said Hagrid, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s what we
call nonmagic folk like them. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s your bad luck
you grew up in a family o&rsquo; the biggest Muggles I ever laid
eyes on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We swore when we took him in we&rsquo;d put a stop to
that rubbish,&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon, &ldquo;swore we&rsquo;d
stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>knew</i>?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;You
<i>knew</i> I&rsquo;m a &mdash; a wizard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Knew!&rdquo; shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly.
&ldquo;<i>Knew</i>! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my
dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like
that and disappeared off to that &mdash; that <i>school</i> &mdash;
and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn,
turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what
she was &mdash; a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it
was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in
the family!&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It
seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.</p><p>&ldquo;Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got
married and had you, and of course I knew you&rsquo;d be just the
same, just as strange, just as &mdash; as &mdash; <i>abnormal</i>
&mdash; and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up
and we got landed with you!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he
said, &ldquo;Blown up? You told me they died in a car
crash!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;CAR CRASH!&rdquo; roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily
that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. &ldquo;How could a
car crash kill Lily an&rsquo; James Potter? It&rsquo;s an outrage!
A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin&rsquo; his own story when every
kid in our world knows his name!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why? What happened?&rdquo; Harry asked urgently.</p><p>The anger faded from Hagrid&rsquo;s face. He looked suddenly
anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;I never expected this,&rdquo; he said, in a low, worried
voice. &ldquo;I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be
trouble gettin&rsquo; hold of yeh, how much yeh didn&rsquo;t know.
Ah, Harry, I don&rsquo; know if I&rsquo;m the right person ter tell
yeh &mdash; but someone&rsquo;s gotta &mdash; yeh can&rsquo;t go
off ter Hogwarts not knowin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh
&mdash; mind, I can&rsquo;t tell yeh everythin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a
great myst&rsquo;ry, parts of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then
said, &ldquo;It begins, I suppose, with &mdash; with a person
called &mdash; but it&rsquo;s incredible yeh don&rsquo;t know his
name, everyone in our world knows &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well &mdash; I don&rsquo; like sayin&rsquo; the name if I
can help it. No one does.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gulpin&rsquo; gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who
went&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse
than worse. His name was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you write it down?&rdquo; Harry suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah &mdash; can&rsquo;t spell it. All right &mdash;
<i>Voldemort.</i>&rdquo; Hagrid shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo; make
me say it again. Anyway, this &mdash; this wizard, about twenty
years ago now, started lookin&rsquo; fer followers. Got &rsquo;em,
too &mdash; some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o&rsquo; his
power, &rsquo;cause he was gettin&rsquo; himself power, all right.
Dark days, Harry. Didn&rsquo;t know who ter trust, didn&rsquo;t
dare get friendly with strange wizards or
witches&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. terrible things happened. He was
takin&rsquo; over. &rsquo;Course, some stood up to him &mdash;
an&rsquo; he killed &rsquo;em. Horribly. One o&rsquo; the only safe
places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore&rsquo;s the only one
You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn&rsquo;t dare try takin&rsquo; the
school, not jus&rsquo; then, anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, yer mum an&rsquo; dad were as good a witch an&rsquo;
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an&rsquo; girl at Hogwarts in their
day! Suppose the myst&rsquo;ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to
get &rsquo;em on his side before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. probably knew
they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin&rsquo; ter do
with the Dark Side.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he thought he could persuade
&rsquo;em&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he just wanted &rsquo;em outta
the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you
was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year
old. He came ter yer house an&rsquo;&mdash; an&rsquo;&mdash;
&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief
and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s that sad
&mdash; knew yer mum an&rsquo; dad, an&rsquo; nicer people yeh
couldn&rsquo;t find &mdash; anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&ldquo;You-Know-Who killed &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; then &mdash;
an&rsquo; this is the real myst&rsquo;ry of the thing &mdash; he
tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I
suppose, or maybe he just liked killin&rsquo; by then. But he
couldn&rsquo;t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That&rsquo;s what yeh get when
a powerful, evil curse touches yeh &mdash; took care of yer mum
an&rsquo; dad an&rsquo; yer house, even &mdash; but it didn&rsquo;t
work on you, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why yer famous, Harry. No one
ever lived after he decided ter kill &rsquo;em, no one except you,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d killed some o&rsquo; the best witches
an&rsquo; wizards of the age &mdash; the McKinnons, the Bones, the
Prewetts &mdash; an&rsquo; you was only a baby, an&rsquo; you
lived.&rdquo;</p><p>Something very painful was going on in Harry&rsquo;s mind. As
Hagrid&rsquo;s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding
flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it
before &mdash; and he remembered something else, for the first time
in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.</p><p>Hagrid was watching him sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on
Dumbledore&rsquo;s orders. Brought yeh ter this
lot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Load of old tosh,&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped;
he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon
certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at
Hagrid and his fists were clenched.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, you listen here, boy,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;I
accept there&rsquo;s something strange about you, probably nothing
a good beating wouldn&rsquo;t have cured &mdash; and as for all
this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it,
and the world&rsquo;s better off without them in my opinion &mdash;
asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types
&mdash; just what I expected, always knew they&rsquo;d come to a
sticky end &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a
battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle
Vernon like a sword, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you, Dursley
&mdash; I&rsquo;m warning you &mdash; one more
word&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a
bearded giant, Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s courage failed again; he
flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Hagrid, breathing
heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged
right down to the floor.</p><p>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of
them.</p><p>&ldquo;But what happened to Vol-, sorry &mdash; I mean,
You-Know-Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night
he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That&rsquo;s the
biggest myst&rsquo;ry, see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was
gettin&rsquo; more an&rsquo; more powerful &mdash; why&rsquo;d he
go?</p><p>&ldquo;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he
had enough human left in him to die. Some say he&rsquo;s still out
there, bidin&rsquo; his time, like, but I don&rsquo; believe it.
People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of &rsquo;em
came outta kinda trances. Don&rsquo; reckon they could&rsquo;ve
done if he was comin&rsquo; back.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of us reckon he&rsquo;s still out there somewhere
but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. &rsquo;Cause
somethin&rsquo; about you finished him, Harry. There was
somethin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on that night he hadn&rsquo;t counted
on &mdash; <i>I</i> dunno what it was, no one does &mdash; but
somethin&rsquo; about you stumped him, all right.&rdquo;</p><p>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his
eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite
sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he
possibly be? He&rsquo;d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and
bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a
wizard, why hadn&rsquo;t they been turned into warty toads every
time they&rsquo;d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he&rsquo;d
once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley
had always been able to kick him around like a football?</p><p>&ldquo;Hagrid,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I think you must
have made a mistake. I don&rsquo;t think I can be a
wizard.&rdquo;</p><p>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was
scared or angry?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every odd thing that had ever made his aunt
and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been
upset or angry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. chased by Dudley&rsquo;s gang,
he had somehow found himself out of their
reach&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dreading going to school with that
ridiculous haircut, he&rsquo;d managed to make it grow
back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the very last time Dudley had hit
him, hadn&rsquo;t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was
doing it? Hadn&rsquo;t he set a boa constrictor on him?</p><p>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was
positively beaming at him.</p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Hagrid. &ldquo;Harry Potter, not a
wizard &mdash; you wait, you&rsquo;ll be right famous at
Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>But Uncle Vernon wasn&rsquo;t going to give in without a
fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you he&rsquo;s not going?&rdquo; he
hissed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to Stonewall High and he&rsquo;ll
be grateful for it. I&rsquo;ve read those letters and he needs all
sorts of rubbish &mdash; spell books and wands and
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won&rsquo;t
stop him,&rdquo; growled Hagrid. &ldquo;Stop Lily an&rsquo; James
Potter&rsquo;s son goin&rsquo; ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His
name&rsquo;s been down ever since he was born. He&rsquo;s off ter
the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven
years there and he won&rsquo;t know himself. He&rsquo;ll be with
youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM
MAGIC TRICKS!&rdquo; yelled Uncle Vernon.</p><p>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and
whirled it over his head, &ldquo;NEVER &mdash;&rdquo; he thundered,
&ldquo;&mdash; INSULT &mdash; ALBUS &mdash; DUMBLEDORE &mdash; IN
&mdash; FRONT &mdash; OF &mdash; ME!&rdquo;</p><p>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point
at Dudley &mdash; there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a
firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was
dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom,
howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly
pig&rsquo;s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.</p><p>Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the
other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed
the door behind them.</p><p>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;ta lost me temper,&rdquo; he said ruefully,
&ldquo;but it didn&rsquo;t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a
pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there
wasn&rsquo;t much left ter do.&rdquo;</p><p>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Be grateful if yeh didn&rsquo;t mention that ter anyone
at Hogwarts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &mdash; er &mdash;
not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin&rsquo;. I was allowed
ter do a bit ter follow yeh an&rsquo; get yer letters to yeh
an&rsquo; stuff &mdash; one o&rsquo; the reasons I was so keen ter
take on the job &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you supposed to do magic?&rdquo; asked
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well &mdash; I was at Hogwarts meself but I &mdash;
er &mdash; got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year.
They snapped me wand in half an&rsquo; everything. But Dumbledore
let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you expelled?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; late and we&rsquo;ve got lots
ter do tomorrow,&rdquo; said Hagrid loudly. &ldquo;Gotta get up ter
town, get all yer books an&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p><p>He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;You can kip under that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;
mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o&rsquo;
dormice in one o&rsquo; the pockets.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
