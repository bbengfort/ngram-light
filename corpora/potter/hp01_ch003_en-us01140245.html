Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment.
By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer
holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video
camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on
his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet
Drive on her crutches.</p><p>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping
Dudley&rsquo;s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers,
Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley
was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The
rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley&rsquo;s
favorite sport: Harry Hunting.</p><p>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the
house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays,
where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would
be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his
life, he wouldn&rsquo;t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at
Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss
was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to
Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was
very funny.</p><p>&ldquo;They stuff people&rsquo;s heads down the toilet the first
day at Stonewall,&rdquo; he told Harry. &ldquo;Want to come
upstairs and practice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;The poor
toilet&rsquo;s never had anything as horrible as your head down it
&mdash; it might be sick.&rdquo; Then he ran, before Dudley could
work out what he&rsquo;d said.</p><p>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his
Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg&rsquo;s. Mrs. Figg
wasn&rsquo;t as bad as usual. It turned out she&rsquo;d broken her
leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn&rsquo;t seem quite
as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave
him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she&rsquo;d had
it for several years.</p><p>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the
family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon
tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called
boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each
other while the teachers weren&rsquo;t looking. This was supposed
to be good training for later life.</p><p>As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon
said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt
Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn&rsquo;t believe it was
her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry
didn&rsquo;t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs
might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.</p><p class="break">There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next
morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming
from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub
was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips
tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.</p><p>&ldquo;Your new school uniform,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Harry looked in the bowl again.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize it had
to be so wet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid,&rdquo; snapped Aunt Petunia.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dyeing some of Dudley&rsquo;s old things gray for
you. It&rsquo;ll look just like everyone else&rsquo;s when
I&rsquo;ve finished.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue.
He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was
going to look on his first day at Stonewall High &mdash; like he
was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.</p><p>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses
because of the smell from Harry&rsquo;s new uniform. Uncle Vernon
opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick,
which he carried everywhere, on the table.</p><p>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat.</p><p>&ldquo;Get the mail, Dudley,&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon from
behind his paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Make Harry get it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get the mail, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make Dudley get it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three
things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s
sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown
envelope that looked like a bill, and &mdash; <i>a letter for
Harry.</i></p><p>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a
giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to
him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives &mdash; he
didn&rsquo;t belong to the library, so he&rsquo;d never even got
rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter,
addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>Mr. H. Potter</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>The Cupboard under the Stairs</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>4 Privet Drive</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Little Whinging</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Surrey</i></p></div></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">The envelope was thick and heavy, made of
yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green
ink. There was no stamp.</p><p>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a
purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger,
and a snake surrounding a large letter <i>H.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hurry up, boy!&rdquo; shouted Uncle Vernon from the
kitchen. &ldquo;What are you doing, checking for letter
bombs?&rdquo; He chuckled at his own joke.</p><p>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He
handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly
began to open the yellow envelope.</p><p>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and
flipped over the postcard.</p><p>&ldquo;Marge&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; he informed Aunt Petunia.
&ldquo;Ate a funny whelk&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; said Dudley suddenly. &ldquo;Dad,
Harry&rsquo;s got something!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was
written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was
jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>mine</i>!&rdquo; said Harry, trying to
snatch it back.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d be writing to you?&rdquo; sneered Uncle
Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic
lights. And it didn&rsquo;t stop there. Within seconds it was the
grayish white of old porridge.</p><p>&ldquo;P-P-Petunia!&rdquo; he gasped.</p><p>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon
held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and
read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might
faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.</p><p>&ldquo;Vernon! Oh my goodness &mdash; Vernon!&rdquo;</p><p>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry
and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn&rsquo;t used to
being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his
Smelting stick.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to read that letter,&rdquo; he said loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> want to read it,&rdquo; said Harry furiously,
&ldquo;as it&rsquo;s <i>mine.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out, both of you,&rdquo; croaked Uncle Vernon,
stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t move.</p><p>&ldquo;I WANT MY LETTER!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> see it!&rdquo; demanded Dudley.</p><p>&ldquo;OUT!&rdquo; roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry
and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the
hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley
promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at
the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one
ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door
and floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Vernon,&rdquo; Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering
voice, &ldquo;look at the address &mdash; how could they possibly
know where he sleeps? You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re watching
the house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Watching &mdash; spying &mdash; might be following
us,&rdquo; muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.</p><p>&ldquo;But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell
them we don&rsquo;t want &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry could see Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s shiny black shoes pacing up
and down the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll ignore
it. If they don&rsquo;t get an answer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes,
that&rsquo;s best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we won&rsquo;t do
anything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not having one in the house, Petunia!
Didn&rsquo;t we swear when we took him in we&rsquo;d stamp out that
dangerous nonsense?&rdquo;</p><p class="break">That evening when he got back from work, Uncle
Vernon did something he&rsquo;d never done before; he visited Harry
in his cupboard.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my letter?&rdquo; said Harry, the moment
Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
writing to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,&rdquo; said
Uncle Vernon shortly. &ldquo;I have burned it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was <i>not</i> a mistake,&rdquo; said Harry angrily,
&ldquo;it had my cupboard on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;SILENCE!&rdquo; yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then
forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</p><p>&ldquo;Er &mdash; yes, Harry &mdash; about this cupboard. Your
aunt and I have been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&rsquo;re
really getting a bit big for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we think it
might be nice if you moved into Dudley&rsquo;s second
bedroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions!&rdquo; snapped his uncle.
&ldquo;Take this stuff upstairs, now.&rdquo;</p><p>The Dursleys&rsquo; house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle
Vernon&rsquo;s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one
where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn&rsquo;t fit
into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to
move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat
down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here
was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small,
working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door
neighbor&rsquo;s dog; in the corner was Dudley&rsquo;s first-ever
television set, which he&rsquo;d put his foot through when his
favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage,
which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for
a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent
because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books.
They were the only things in the room that looked as though
they&rsquo;d never been touched.</p><p>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> him in there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I <i>need</i> that room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make him get
out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he&rsquo;d
have given anything to be up here. Today he&rsquo;d rather be back
in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.</p><p class="break">Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather
quiet. Dudley was in shock. He&rsquo;d screamed, whacked his father
with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother,
and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still
didn&rsquo;t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time
yesterday and bitterly wishing he&rsquo;d opened the letter in the
hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other
darkly.</p><p>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to
be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging
things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he
shouted, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another one! &lsquo;Mr. H. Potter,
The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive &mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran
down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle
Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made
difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around
the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which
everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon
straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry&rsquo;s letter
clutched in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to your cupboard &mdash; I mean, your bedroom,&rdquo;
he wheezed at Harry. &ldquo;Dudley &mdash; go &mdash; just
go.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had
moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn&rsquo;t
received his first letter. Surely that meant they&rsquo;d try
again? And this time he&rsquo;d make sure they didn&rsquo;t fail.
He had a plan.</p><p class="break">The repaired alarm clock rang at six o&rsquo;clock
the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently.
He mustn&rsquo;t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without
turning on any of the lights.</p><p>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet
Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered
as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door &mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;AAAAARRRGH!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry leapt into the air; he&rsquo;d trodden on something big
and squashy on the doormat &mdash; something <i>alive</i>!</p><p>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that
the big, squashy something had been his uncle&rsquo;s face. Uncle
Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping
bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn&rsquo;t do exactly what
he&rsquo;d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an
hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled
miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the
mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s lap. Harry could
see three letters addressed in green ink.</p><p>&ldquo;I want &mdash;&rdquo; he began, but Uncle Vernon was
tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</p><p>Uncle Vernon didn&rsquo;t go to work that day. He stayed at home
and nailed up the mail slot.</p><p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he explained to Aunt Petunia through a
mouthful of nails, &ldquo;if they can&rsquo;t <i>deliver</i> them
they&rsquo;ll just give up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;ll work, Vernon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, these people&rsquo;s minds work in strange ways,
Petunia, they&rsquo;re not like you and me,&rdquo; said Uncle
Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt
Petunia had just brought him.</p><p class="break">On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for
Harry. As they couldn&rsquo;t go through the mail slot they had
been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few
even forced through the small window in the downstairs
bathroom.</p><p>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the
letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks
around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed
&ldquo;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&rdquo; as he worked, and jumped at
small noises.</p><p class="break">On Saturday, things began to get out of hand.
Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled
up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very
confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room
window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post
office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt
Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.</p><p>&ldquo;Who on earth wants to talk to <i>you</i> this
badly?&rdquo; Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</p><p id="HP01CH03M01S" class="break">&nbsp;On Sunday morning,
Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and
rather ill, but happy.</p><p>&ldquo;No post on Sundays,&rdquo; he reminded them cheerfully as
he spread marmalade on his newspapers, &ldquo;no damn letters today
&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and
caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or
forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The
Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one
&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Out! OUT!&rdquo;</p><p>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into
the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms
over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could
hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the
walls and floor.</p><p id="HP01CH03M01E">&ldquo;That does it,&rdquo; said Uncle
Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his
mustache at the same time. &ldquo;I want you all back here in five
minutes ready to leave. We&rsquo;re going away. Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!&rdquo;</p><p>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no
one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way
through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward
the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had
hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack
his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.</p><p>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn&rsquo;t dare
ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would
take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a
while.</p><p>&ldquo;Shake &rsquo;em off&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shake &rsquo;em
off,&rdquo; he would mutter whenever he did this.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall
Dudley was howling. He&rsquo;d never had such a bad day in his
life. He was hungry, he&rsquo;d missed five television programs
he&rsquo;d wanted to see, and he&rsquo;d never gone so long without
blowing up an alien on his computer.</p><p>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on
the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with
twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed
awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of
passing cars and wondering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p class="break">They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes
on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when
the owner of the hotel came over to their table.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I
got about an &rsquo;undred of these at the front desk.&rdquo;</p><p>She held up a letter so they could read the green ink
address:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent"><i>Mr. H. Potter</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Room 17</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Railview Hotel</i></p><p class="noindent"><i>Cokeworth</i></p></div></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle
Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them,&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon, standing
up quickly and following her from the dining room.</p><p class="break">&nbsp;&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better just to
go home, dear?&rdquo; Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later,
but Uncle Vernon didn&rsquo;t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was
looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a
forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the
car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle
of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the
top of a multilevel parking garage.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s gone mad, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Dudley
asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had
parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and
disappeared.</p><p>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car.
Dudley sniveled.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Monday,&rdquo; he told his mother. &ldquo;The
Great Humberto&rsquo;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a
<i>television.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it <i>was</i>
Monday &mdash; and you could usually count on Dudley to know the
days of the week, because of television &mdash; then tomorrow,
Tuesday, was Harry&rsquo;s eleventh birthday. Of course, his
birthdays were never exactly fun &mdash; last year, the Dursleys
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s old
socks. Still, you weren&rsquo;t eleven every day.</p><p>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a
long, thin package and didn&rsquo;t answer Aunt Petunia when she
asked what he&rsquo;d bought.</p><p>&ldquo;Found the perfect place!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come on!
Everyone out!&rdquo;</p><p id="HP01CH03M02S">It was very cold outside the car.
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out
at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little
shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no
television in there.</p><p>&ldquo;Storm forecast for tonight!&rdquo; said Uncle Vernon
gleefully, clapping his hands together. &ldquo;And this
gentleman&rsquo;s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!&rdquo;</p><p>A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a
rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray
water below them.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already got us some rations,&rdquo; said Uncle
Vernon, &ldquo;so all aboard!&rdquo;</p><p>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down
their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what
seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon,
slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.</p><p id="HP01CH03M02E">The inside was horrible; it smelled
strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the
wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only
two rooms.</p><p>Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s rations turned out to be a bag of chips
each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip
bags just smoked and shriveled up.</p><p>&ldquo;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&rdquo; he
said cheerfully.</p><p>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a
chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry
privately agreed, though the thought didn&rsquo;t cheer him up at
all.</p><p>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray
from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce
wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy
blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the
moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed
next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he
could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.</p><p>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.
Harry couldn&rsquo;t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to
get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley&rsquo;s
snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near
midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley&rsquo;s watch, which was
dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry
he&rsquo;d be eleven in ten minutes&rsquo; time. He lay and watched
his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember
at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.</p><p>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He
hoped the roof wasn&rsquo;t going to fall in, although he might be
warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet
Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that
he&rsquo;d be able to steal one somehow.</p><p>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock
like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching
noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</p><p>One minute to go and he&rsquo;d be eleven. Thirty
seconds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twenty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
ten&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nine &mdash; maybe he&rsquo;d wake Dudley
up, just to annoy him &mdash; three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>BOOM.</p><p>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at
the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</p></body></html>
