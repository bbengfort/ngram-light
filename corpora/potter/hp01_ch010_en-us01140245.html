believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at
Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the
three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were
quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron
in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts
to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could
possibly need such heavy protection.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either really valuable or really
dangerous,&rdquo; said Ron.</p>    <p>&ldquo;Or both,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>   <p>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was
that it was about two inches long, they didn&rsquo;t have much
chance of guessing what it was without further clues.</p>    <p>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in
what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared
about was never going near the dog again.</p>     <p>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was
such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All
they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to
their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a
week later.</p>    <p>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual,
everyone&rsquo;s attention was caught at once by a long, thin
package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as
interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,
and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in
front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top
of the parcel.</p>      <p>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it
said:</p><div class="block"><div><div class="block"><div class="topbot"><p class="noindent">DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE
TABLE.</p><p class="noindent">It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I
don&rsquo;t want everybody knowing you&rsquo;ve got a broomstick or
they&rsquo;ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on
the Quidditch field at seven o&rsquo;clock for your first training
session.</p><p class="noindent"><img src="images/professor_sig.jpg" width="250" height="61" alt="Professor M McGonagall Signature"/></p></div></div></div></div><p class="noindent">Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he
handed the note to Ron to read.</p><p>&ldquo;A Nimbus Two Thousand!&rdquo; Ron moaned enviously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even <i>touched</i> one.&rdquo;</p><p>They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in
private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance
hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy
seized the package from Harry and felt it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a broomstick,&rdquo; he said, throwing it
back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years
aren&rsquo;t allowed them.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron couldn&rsquo;t resist it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not any old broomstick,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say
you&rsquo;ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?&rdquo; Ron
grinned at Harry. &ldquo;Comets look flashy, but they&rsquo;re not
in the same league as the Nimbus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn&rsquo;t
afford half the handle,&rdquo; Malfoy snapped back. &ldquo;I
suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by
twig.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at
Malfoy&rsquo;s elbow.</p><p>&ldquo;Not arguing, I hope, boys?&rdquo; he squeaked.</p><p>&ldquo;Potter&rsquo;s been sent a broomstick, Professor,&rdquo;
said Malfoy quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Professor
Flitwick, beaming at Harry. &ldquo;Professor McGonagall told me all
about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is
it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,&rdquo; said Harry, fighting
not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s really thanks to Malfoy here that I&rsquo;ve
got it,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at
Malfoy&rsquo;s obvious rage and confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Harry chortled as they
reached the top of the marble staircase, &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t
stolen Neville&rsquo;s Remembrall I wouldn&rsquo;t be on the
team.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I suppose you think that&rsquo;s a reward for breaking
rules?&rdquo; came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione
was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package
in Harry&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t speaking to us?&rdquo; said
Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t stop now,&rdquo; said Ron,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s doing us so much good.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</p><p id="HP01CH10M01S">Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his
mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory
where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off
to the Quidditch field where he&rsquo;d be learning to play that
night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he
was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus
Two Thousand at last.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto
Harry&rsquo;s bedspread.</p><p>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought
it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it
had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand
written in gold near the top.</p><p id="HP01CH10M01E">As seven o&rsquo;clock drew nearer,
Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch
field. He&rsquo;d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of
seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators
were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the
field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded
Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles
through, except that they were fifty feet high.</p><p>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his
broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling &mdash;
he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down
the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his
lightest touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Potter, come down!&rdquo;</p><p>Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate
under his arm. Harry landed next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; said Wood, his eyes glinting. &ldquo;I
see what McGonagall meant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you really are a
natural. I&rsquo;m just going to teach you the rules this evening,
then you&rsquo;ll be joining team practice three times a
week.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Wood. &ldquo;Now, Quidditch is easy
enough to understand, even if it&rsquo;s not too easy to play.
There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called
Chasers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three Chasers,&rdquo; Harry repeated, as Wood took out a
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</p><p>&ldquo;This ball&rsquo;s called the Quaffle,&rdquo; said Wood.
&ldquo;The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get
it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time
the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the
hoops to score,&rdquo; Harry recited. &ldquo;So &mdash;
that&rsquo;s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s basketball?&rdquo; said Wood curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Harry quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s another player on each side
who&rsquo;s called the Keeper &mdash; I&rsquo;m Keeper for
Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team
from scoring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three Chasers, one Keeper,&rdquo; said Harry, who was
determined to remember it all. &ldquo;And they play with the
Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?&rdquo; He pointed at
the three balls left inside the box.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you now,&rdquo; said Wood. &ldquo;Take
this.&rdquo;</p><p>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball
bat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you what the Bludgers do,&rdquo;
Wood said. &ldquo;These two are the Bludgers.&rdquo;</p><p>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly
smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be
straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.</p><p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; Wood warned Harry. He bent down and
freed one of the Bludgers.</p><p>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted
straight at Harry&rsquo;s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to
stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into
the air &mdash; it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood,
who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger
back into the crate and strapping it down safely. &ldquo;The
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.
That&rsquo;s why you have two Beaters on each team &mdash; the
Weasley twins are ours &mdash; it&rsquo;s their job to protect
their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the
other team. So &mdash; think you&rsquo;ve got all that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper
guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their
team,&rdquo; Harry reeled off.</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Wood.</p><p>&ldquo;Er &mdash; have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?&rdquo;
Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.</p><p>&ldquo;Never at Hogwarts. We&rsquo;ve had a couple of broken
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team
is the Seeker. That&rsquo;s you. And you don&rsquo;t have to worry
about the Quaffle or the Bludgers &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; unless they crack my head open.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for
the Bludgers &mdash; I mean, they&rsquo;re like a pair of human
Bludgers themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last
ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny,
about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little
fluttering silver wings.</p><p><i>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;</i> said Wood, &ldquo;is the Golden
Snitch, and it&rsquo;s the most important ball of the lot.
It&rsquo;s very hard to catch because it&rsquo;s so fast and
difficult to see. It&rsquo;s the Seeker&rsquo;s job to catch it.
You&rsquo;ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,
Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team&rsquo;s
Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team
an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.
That&rsquo;s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch
only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages
&mdash; I think the record is three months, they had to keep
bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s it &mdash; any questions?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right,
it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t practice with the Snitch yet,&rdquo; said
Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s too dark, we might lose it. Let&rsquo;s try you
out with a few of these.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a
few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing
the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to
catch.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.
After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn&rsquo;t
carry on.</p><p>&ldquo;That Quidditch Cup&rsquo;ll have our name on it this
year,&rdquo; said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the
castle. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you turn out better
than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he
hadn&rsquo;t gone off chasing dragons.&rdquo;</p><p class="break">Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what
with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his
homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that
he&rsquo;d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt
more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were
becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the
basics.</p><p id="HP01CH10M02S">On Halloween morning they woke to the
delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.
Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought
they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all
been dying to try since they&rsquo;d seen him make Neville&rsquo;s
toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class
into pairs to practice. Harry&rsquo;s partner was Seamus Finnigan
(which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his
eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was
hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She
hadn&rsquo;t spoken to either of them since the day Harry&rsquo;s
broomstick had arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t forget that nice wrist movement
we&rsquo;ve been practicing!&rdquo; squeaked Professor Flitwick,
perched on top of his pile of books as usual. &ldquo;Swish and
flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words
properly is very important, too &mdash; never forget Wizard
Baruffio, who said &lsquo;s&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;f&rsquo; and
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.&rdquo;</p><p>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but
the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on
the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his
wand and set fire to it &mdash; Harry had to put it out with his
hat.</p><p>Ron, at the next table, wasn&rsquo;t having much more luck.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Wingardium Leviosa!&rdquo;</i> he shouted, waving his
long arms like a windmill.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying it wrong,&rdquo; Harry heard Hermione
snap. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Wing-<i>gar</i>-dium Levi-<i>o</i>-sa, make
the &lsquo;gar&rsquo; nice and long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do it, then, if you&rsquo;re so clever,&rdquo; Ron
snarled.</p><p>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand,
and said, <i>&ldquo;Wingardium Leviosa!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet
above their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well done!&rdquo; cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.
&ldquo;Everyone see here, Miss Granger&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo;</p><p>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.</p><p id="HP01CH10M02E">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder no one can
stand her,&rdquo; he said to Harry as they pushed their way into
the crowded corridor, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a nightmare,
honestly.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was
Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face &mdash; and was
startled to see that she was in tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I think she heard you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
&ldquo;She must&rsquo;ve noticed she&rsquo;s got no
friends.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione didn&rsquo;t turn up for the next class and
wasn&rsquo;t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great
Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil
telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the
girls&rsquo; bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still
more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great
Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their
minds.</p><p>A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while
a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making
the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on
the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.</p><p>Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor
Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror
on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor
Dumbledore&rsquo;s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped,
&ldquo;Troll &mdash; in the dungeons &mdash; thought you ought to
know.&rdquo;</p><p>He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.</p><p>There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers
exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore&rsquo;s wand to
bring silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Prefects,&rdquo; he rumbled, &ldquo;lead your Houses back
to the dormitories immediately!&rdquo;</p><p>Percy was in his element.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make
way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I&rsquo;m a
prefect!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could a troll get in?&rdquo; Harry asked as they
climbed the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, they&rsquo;re supposed to be really
stupid,&rdquo; said Ron. &ldquo;Maybe Peeves let it in for a
Halloween joke.&rdquo;</p><p>They passed different groups of people hurrying in different
directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused
Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just thought &mdash; Hermione.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know about the troll.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron bit his lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;But
Percy&rsquo;d better not see us.&rdquo;</p><p>Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,
slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the
girls&rsquo; bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they
heard quick footsteps behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;Percy!&rdquo; hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large
stone griffin.</p><p>Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He
crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; Harry whispered. &ldquo;Why
isn&rsquo;t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the
teachers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Search me.&rdquo;</p><p>Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after
Snape&rsquo;s fading footsteps.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading for the third floor,&rdquo; Harry
said, but Ron held up his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you smell something?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture
of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to
clean.</p><p id="HP01CH10M03S">And then they heard it &mdash; a low
grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed
&mdash; at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was
moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it
emerged into a patch of moonlight.</p><p>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull,
granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small
bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as
tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was
incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along
the floor because its arms were so long.</p><p>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It
waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched
slowly into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;The key&rsquo;s in the lock,&rdquo; Harry muttered.
&ldquo;We could lock it in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Ron nervously.</p><p>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll
wasn&rsquo;t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry
managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the
passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that
made their hearts stop &mdash; a high, petrified scream &mdash; and
it was coming from the chamber they&rsquo;d just chained up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the girls&rsquo; bathroom!&rdquo; Harry
gasped.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hermione!&rdquo;</i> they said together.</p><p>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did
they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and
turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open
and they ran inside.</p><p>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite,
looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on
her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.</p><p>&ldquo;Confuse it!&rdquo; Harry said desperately to Ron, and,
seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the
wall.</p><p>The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around,
blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little
eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting
its club as it went.</p><p>&ldquo;Oy, pea-brain!&rdquo; yelled Ron from the other side of
the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll
didn&rsquo;t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but
it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward
Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, run, <i>run</i>!&rdquo; Harry yelled at
Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she
couldn&rsquo;t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth
open with terror.</p><p>The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll
berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest
and had no way to escape.</p><p id="HP01CH10M03E">Harry then did something that was both
very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and
managed to fasten his arms around the troll&rsquo;s neck from
behind. The troll couldn&rsquo;t feel Harry hanging there, but even
a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose,
and Harry&rsquo;s wand had still been in his hand when he&rsquo;d
jumped &mdash; it had gone straight up one of the troll&rsquo;s
nostrils.</p><p>Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with
Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to
rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.</p><p>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own
wand &mdash; not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself
cry the first spell that came into his head: <i>&ldquo;Wingardium
Leviosa!&rdquo;</i></p><p>The club flew suddenly out of the troll&rsquo;s hand, rose high,
high up into the air, turned slowly over &mdash; and dropped, with
a sickening crack, onto its owner&rsquo;s head. The troll swayed on
the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the
whole room tremble.</p><p>Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had
done.</p><p>It was Hermione who spoke first.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it &mdash; dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I think
it&rsquo;s just been knocked out.&rdquo;</p><p>He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll&rsquo;s nose.
It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.</p><p>&ldquo;Urgh &ndash; troll boogers.&rdquo;</p><p>He wiped it on the troll&rsquo;s trousers.</p><p>A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look
up. They hadn&rsquo;t realized what a racket they had been making,
but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and
the troll&rsquo;s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had
come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with
Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,
let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet,
clutching his heart.</p><p>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at
Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips
were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded
quickly from Harry&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth were you thinking of?&rdquo; said Professor
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who
was still standing with his wand in the air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
lucky you weren&rsquo;t killed. Why aren&rsquo;t you in your
dormitory?&rdquo;</p><p>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the
floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</p><p>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Professor McGonagall &mdash; they were looking
for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Granger!&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</p><p>&ldquo;I went looking for the troll because I &mdash; I thought
I could deal with it on my own &mdash; you know, because I&rsquo;ve
read all about them.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie
to a teacher?</p><p>&ldquo;If they hadn&rsquo;t found me, I&rsquo;d be dead now.
Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its
own club. They didn&rsquo;t have time to come and fetch anyone. It
was about to finish me off when they arrived.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn&rsquo;t
new to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Well &mdash; in that case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;
said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them,
&ldquo;Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the
last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was,
pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape
had started handing out sweets.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor
for this,&rdquo; said Professor McGonagall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
disappointed in you. If you&rsquo;re not hurt at all, you&rsquo;d
better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the
feast in their Houses.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione left.</p><p>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win
Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of
this. You may go.&rdquo;</p><p>They hurried out of the chamber and didn&rsquo;t speak at all
until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away
from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;We should have gotten more than ten points,&rdquo; Ron
grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Five, you mean, once she&rsquo;s taken off
Hermione&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,&rdquo;
Ron admitted. &ldquo;Mind you, we <i>did</i> save her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She might not have needed saving if we hadn&rsquo;t
locked the thing in with her,&rdquo; Harry reminded him.</p><p>They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.</p><p>&ldquo;Pig snout,&rdquo; they said and entered.</p><p>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the
food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the
