passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the
front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun
rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number
four on the Dursleys&rsquo; front door; it crept into their living
room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night
when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time
had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what
looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored
bonnets &mdash; but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now
the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle,
on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father,
being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all
that another boy lived in the house, too.</p><p id="HP01CH02M01S">Yet Harry Potter was still there,
asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake
and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the
day.</p><p>&ldquo;Up! Get up! Now!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.</p><p>&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the
stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he
had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he&rsquo;d had the same
dream before.</p><p>His aunt was back outside the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you up yet?&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; said Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon.
And don&rsquo;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on
Duddy&rsquo;s birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; his aunt snapped through the
door.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Dudley&rsquo;s birthday &mdash; how could he have forgotten?
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found
a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them,
put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under
the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.</p><p>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The
table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley&rsquo;s birthday
presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he
wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as
Dudley was very fat and hated exercise &mdash; unless of course it
involved punching somebody. Dudley&rsquo;s favorite punching bag
was Harry, but he couldn&rsquo;t often catch him. Harry
didn&rsquo;t look it, but he was very fast.</p><p>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard,
but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked
even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to
wear were old clothes of Dudley&rsquo;s, and Dudley was about four
times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees,
black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held
together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley
had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his
own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped
like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</p><p id="HP01CH02M01E">&ldquo;In the car crash when your
parents died,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t ask
questions.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t ask questions</i> &mdash; that was the first rule
for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</p><p>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the
bacon.</p><p>&ldquo;Comb your hair!&rdquo; he barked, by way of a morning
greeting.</p><p>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his
newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have
had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put
together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way
&mdash; all over the place.</p><p>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen
with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a
large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick
blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel &mdash; Harry often
said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.</p><p>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was
difficult as there wasn&rsquo;t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was
counting his presents. His face fell.</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-six,&rdquo; he said, looking up at his mother and
father. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s two less than last year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, you haven&rsquo;t counted Auntie Marge&rsquo;s
present, see, it&rsquo;s here under this big one from Mummy and
Daddy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, thirty-seven then,&rdquo; said Dudley, going
red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming
on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley
turned the table over.</p><p>Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said
quickly, &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll buy you another two presents while
we&rsquo;re out today. How&rsquo;s that, popkin? <i>Two</i> more
presents. Is that all right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally
he said slowly, &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll have
thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-nine, sweetums,&rdquo; said Aunt Petunia.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the
nearest parcel. &ldquo;All right then.&rdquo;</p><p>Uncle Vernon chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Little tyke wants his money&rsquo;s worth, just like his
father. &rsquo;Atta boy, Dudley!&rdquo; He ruffled Dudley&rsquo;s
hair.</p><p>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to
answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the
racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold
wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking
both angry and worried.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad news, Vernon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mrs.
Figg&rsquo;s broken her leg. She can&rsquo;t take him.&rdquo; She
jerked her head in Harry&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>Dudley&rsquo;s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry&rsquo;s
heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley&rsquo;s birthday, his
parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks,
hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left
behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.
Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs.
Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she&rsquo;d ever
owned.</p><p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at
Harry as though he&rsquo;d planned this. Harry knew he ought to
feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn&rsquo;t
easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he
had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</p><p>&ldquo;We could phone Marge,&rdquo; Uncle Vernon suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Vernon, she hates the
boy.&rdquo;</p><p>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he
wasn&rsquo;t there &mdash; or rather, as though he was something
very nasty that couldn&rsquo;t understand them, like a slug.</p><p>&ldquo;What about what&rsquo;s-her-name, your friend &mdash;
Yvonne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On vacation in Majorca,&rdquo; snapped Aunt Petunia.</p><p>&ldquo;You could just leave me here,&rdquo; Harry put in
hopefully (he&rsquo;d be able to watch what he wanted on television
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley&rsquo;s
computer).</p><p>Aunt Petunia looked as though she&rsquo;d just swallowed a
lemon.</p><p>&ldquo;And come back and find the house in ruins?&rdquo; she
snarled.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t blow up the house,&rdquo; said Harry, but
they weren&rsquo;t listening.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we could take him to the zoo,&rdquo; said Aunt
Petunia slowly, &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and leave him in the
car.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That car&rsquo;s new, he&rsquo;s not sitting in it
alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn&rsquo;t really
crying &mdash; it had been years since he&rsquo;d really cried
&mdash; but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his
mother would give him anything he wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Dinky Duddydums, don&rsquo;t cry, Mummy won&rsquo;t let
him spoil your special day!&rdquo; she cried, flinging her arms
around him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. t-t-to
come!&rdquo; Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. &ldquo;He
always sp-spoils everything!&rdquo; He shot Harry a nasty grin
through the gap in his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>Just then, the doorbell rang &mdash;&ldquo;Oh, good Lord,
they&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; said Aunt Petunia frantically &mdash;
and a moment later, Dudley&rsquo;s best friend, Piers Polkiss,
walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like
a rat. He was usually the one who held people&rsquo;s arms behind
their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry
at once.</p><p>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn&rsquo;t believe his luck,
was sitting in the back of the Dursleys&rsquo; car with Piers and
Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His
aunt and uncle hadn&rsquo;t been able to think of anything else to
do with him, but before they&rsquo;d left, Uncle Vernon had taken
Harry aside.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you,&rdquo; he had said, putting his
large purple face right up close to Harry&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
warning you now, boy &mdash; any funny business, anything at all
&mdash; and you&rsquo;ll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do anything,&rdquo; said Harry,
&ldquo;honestly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p><p>But Uncle Vernon didn&rsquo;t believe him. No one ever did.</p><p>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and
it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn&rsquo;t make them
happen.</p><p>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers
looking as though he hadn&rsquo;t been at all, had taken a pair of
kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald
except for his bangs, which she left &ldquo;to hide that horrible
scar.&rdquo; Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a
sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already
laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning,
however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been
before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in
his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> explain how it had grown back so quickly.</p><p>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a
revolting old sweater of Dudley&rsquo;s (brown with orange puff
balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller
it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand
puppet, but certainly wouldn&rsquo;t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had
decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief,
Harry wasn&rsquo;t punished.</p><p>On the other hand, he&rsquo;d gotten into terrible trouble for
being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley&rsquo;s gang
had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry&rsquo;s
surprise as anyone else&rsquo;s, there he was sitting on the
chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from
Harry&rsquo;s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing
school buildings. But all he&rsquo;d tried to do (as he shouted at
Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump
behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed
that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.</p><p>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth
being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that
wasn&rsquo;t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg&rsquo;s
cabbage-smelling living room.</p><p>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He
liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council,
Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite
subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.</p><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. roaring along like maniacs, the young
hoodlums,&rdquo; he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a dream about a motorcycle,&rdquo; said Harry,
remembering suddenly. &ldquo;It was flying.&rdquo;</p><p>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned
right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a
gigantic beet with a mustache: &ldquo;MOTORCYCLES DON&rsquo;T
FLY!&rdquo;</p><p>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</p><p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It was
only a dream.&rdquo;</p><p>But he wished he hadn&rsquo;t said anything. If there was one
thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it
was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn&rsquo;t,
no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon &mdash; they
seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.</p><p>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with
families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice
creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the
van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him
away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn&rsquo;t bad,
either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla
scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that
it wasn&rsquo;t blond.</p><p>Harry had the best morning he&rsquo;d had in a long time. He was
careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley
and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by
lunchtime, wouldn&rsquo;t fall back on their favorite hobby of
hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn&rsquo;t have enough
ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was
allowed to finish the first.</p><p>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too
good to last.</p><p id="HP01CH02M02S">After lunch they went to the reptile
house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along
the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were
crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and
Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing
pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It
could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s car
and crushed it into a trash can &mdash; but at the moment it
didn&rsquo;t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p><p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at
the glistening brown coils.</p><p>&ldquo;Make it move,&rdquo; he whined at his father. Uncle
Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn&rsquo;t budge.</p><p>&ldquo;Do it again,&rdquo; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped
the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed
on.</p><p>&ldquo;This is boring,&rdquo; Dudley moaned. He shuffled
away.</p><p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the
snake. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised if it had died of
boredom itself &mdash; no company except stupid people drumming
their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It
was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only
visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at
least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p><p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly,
it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with
Harry&rsquo;s.</p><p><i>It winked.</i></p><p>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren&rsquo;t. He looked back at the snake and
winked, too.</p><p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then
raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said
quite plainly:</p><p><i>&ldquo;I get that all the time.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Harry murmured through the glass, though
he wasn&rsquo;t sure the snake could hear him. &ldquo;It must be
really annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>The snake nodded vigorously.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you come from, anyway?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.
Harry peered at it.</p><p>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it nice there?&rdquo;</p><p>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry
read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. &ldquo;Oh, I see
&mdash; so you&rsquo;ve never been to Brazil?&rdquo;</p><p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made
both of them jump. &ldquo;DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT
THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&rsquo;T <i>BELIEVE</i> WHAT IT&rsquo;S
DOING!&rdquo;</p><p>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.</p><p>&ldquo;Out of the way, you,&rdquo; he said, punching Harry in
the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete
floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened
&mdash; one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to
the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.</p><p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa
constrictor&rsquo;s tank had vanished. The great snake was
uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People
throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the
exits.</p><p id="HP01CH02M02E">As the snake slid swiftly past him,
Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, &ldquo;Brazil,
here I come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thanksss, amigo.&rdquo;</p><p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;But the glass,&rdquo; he kept saying, &ldquo;where did
the glass go?&rdquo;</p><p>The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong,
sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley
could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn&rsquo;t
done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed,
but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s car,
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while
Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say,
&ldquo;Harry was talking to it, weren&rsquo;t you,
Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house
before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He
managed to say, &ldquo;Go &mdash; cupboard &mdash; stay &mdash; no
meals,&rdquo; before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia
had to run and get him a large brandy.</p><p class="break">Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing
he had a watch. He didn&rsquo;t know what time it was and he
couldn&rsquo;t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they
were, he couldn&rsquo;t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some
food.</p><p>He&rsquo;d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten
miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since
he&rsquo;d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.
He couldn&rsquo;t remember being in the car when his parents had
died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in
his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of
green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed,
was the crash, though he couldn&rsquo;t imagine where all the green
light came from. He couldn&rsquo;t remember his parents at all. His
aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was
forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in
the house.</p><p>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some
unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never
happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he
thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to
know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a
violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt
Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the
man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying
anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved
merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat
had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these
people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to
get a closer look.</p><p>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&rsquo;s
gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and
broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&rsquo;s
gang.</p></body></html>
